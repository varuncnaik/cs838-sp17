I recommend making a reservation on a Saturday because they are really busy. My friend and I had <miso soup> and <sushi>. The soup was delicious and the sushi was to die for. The waiter suggested the <duck roll> so we ordered the <duck roll>, <spicy shrimp roll>, and <soft shell crab roll>. They were all amazing but the duck roll gets huge points for originality! We almost ordered another one, but we were too full!! We didn't get dessert but I'm assuming it was good-the table next to us were eating their <caramel sauce> with their spoons!
