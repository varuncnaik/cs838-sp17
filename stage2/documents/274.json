Delicious!\n\nGraze is one of my favorite restaurants in Madison. I love the emphasis on supporting local farmers and using fresh ingredients.\n\nThe food is flavorful and nicely plated. Everything I've tried has been great. The <burger> is juicy and delicious.  The <bibimbap> was superb and spicy. Every bite is like a party in your mouth!  \n\nThe drinks here are amazing! My favorite drink at the moment is the <springing in the rain> drink. The cucumber is very refreshing.\n\nThis is also a great place for brunch. The <scramblers> are delicious, and the <Bloody Mary's> are loaded with goodies!","useful":7,"funny":0,"cool":3,"type":"review","restaurant":{"name":"Graze","neighborhood":"Capitol","address":"1 S Pinckney St","city":"Madison","state":"WI","postal_code":"53703","latitude":43.075094045,"longitude":-89.3820914577,"stars":4.0,"review_count":777,"is_open":1,"attributes":["Alcohol: full_bar","Ambience: {'romantic': False, 'intimate': False, 'classy': False, 'hipster': False, 'divey': False, 'touristy': False, 'trendy': True, 'upscale': False, 'casual': False}","BikeParking: True","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards: True","BusinessParking: {'garage': False, 'street': True, 'validated': False, 'lot': False, 'valet': False}","Caters: False","GoodForKids: False","GoodForMeal: {'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': False, 'dinner': True, 'breakfast': False, 'brunch': False}","HasTV: False","NoiseLevel: average","OutdoorSeating: True","RestaurantsAttire: casual","RestaurantsDelivery: False","RestaurantsGoodForGroups: True","RestaurantsPriceRange2: 2","RestaurantsReservations: False","RestaurantsTableService: True","RestaurantsTakeOut: True","WheelchairAccessible: True","WiFi: free"],"categories":["Restaurants","American (New)","Gastropubs"],"hours":["Monday 11:0-22:0","Tuesday 11:0-22:0","Wednesday 11:0-22:0","Thursday 11:0-22:0","Friday 11:0-23:0","Saturday 9:30-23:0","Sunday 9:30-15:0"],"type":"business"},"user":{"name":"Kelly","review_count":134,"yelping_since":"2010-11-11","friends":["RTWsMisf73pGnbagf1vmvg","JUT0U3HTSB3kz9Wh7N0GqA","NdRnUWxham7htMtOaCxPXA","kzz4lKJl5b-Kqs6f_H7u3w","ZqA1uz4u8GzL5whUuPCclg","CLBhU0yc2OPoJTRRSdqN8Q","7x5y-u6-0PA42lXT6fx2vw","BVHZ6w_YgA1lt8Rnq4NSCg","YSb8JRyI75M8FkbYWLH4UA","Yk7uDMZfOBFqMYe4rXg3fg","BXuxdO-lBL4tdg1-AthsaQ","RD-f1At-TwojTfXFuyN5ag","UTh2BbWoWyDMwNyoWPDYGQ","8teQ4Zc9jpl_ffaPJUn6Ew","GVuU1qYR_pWFEVezVjm8hQ","wd3xoNaDLib8dhQ7BxUl6g","cDhs0eRMGtVVXzr5eiGiIQ","KGY_eZHm3AderjlcnLhoRw","lrgq-Gr-l8m0v5WEmVXP6g","f7Emr9Q4H5r_jO_DW3QuIQ","jvFYKmBB80FDql8euBtl4A","iB8FSPRTYeD3pZySNtkD7A","0jYk3UECQLepokzzX3hlkA","53o-Xyyk2sEO4Fg-et1MhA","pX0pzOHkOH4_zsRh0F_6YA","8ZLAklUl3vS9cnlwpv3v5g","r5H1fOXryfyi2hkDC0tQRg","Ao2VYIw9AMKOTiCUwe_T9A","jL1TI1E0Yc0y-yQKCh307A","LRi2DFvZjvry-DiQkUeD2Q","yJP-54fC6lpYXXl5X0JyJw","AG75FucShh2DK_tOG7WIyA","d5WLqmTMvmL7-RmUDVKqqQ","Jnx8GE372nbzljZ5VqZcGA","SRJV_DzWUG_KlBoCvVN4NQ","kz8Bxh4Azss6hINcRRwOEg","_MpNCFNXmpy2JtxcWuySmw","5MKqkzDbludCpSqBlZU3Kg","i8Ejy_R5HnTwFn2tNng4hA","ogSm83N87_O1jccO4t03IQ","pSYjXb62QotWzt4RKt56pw","DmdksmfNKLV50R-8Rz5FgQ","gOBemMfKRfpvJkz9OIw6aw","m3Y6mzgjSEHjFzabDJHpxQ","IA-d16voCuMdISqVVvyfOA","TyGt2KefXBnjVbibNFd5FA","77cFD1N1PtMVmGrqs9af5A","qDTwrRBQiW8ls2Xd2kXY2g","yvxURjhhK7WmeGo-bVUlqw","0S8hkTzk48JQiL_C0VV29A","FKclATu5-fmK6lsAUuHp7w","6KxmLHVqJIP0tFeepctOwA","fJ_qSZH_akvWzHUPMqab1g","NwXV_WofVAmhZjfQvu6y0w","_inRKZBeHkwfgI1nkssHDQ","4q02ALXu_6i7-GWZAW9ctQ","tOMfTEKuz21M9bNPJMH9JQ","EXKDLuYoZUKUNNNYA7TlGQ","9OcXy4NV_f5n0HHmTc2PcA","eAqjr-5h0PpzmBcUmNrLXw","3cSPZMXjSwSXqNe18w-5Zw","Nhdgvn2liXqxf8tRDK2U5g","2NWKoTSkkF-s80oxPjHZSw","FzB5upY1YTAFcbl6ReR6jw"],"useful":200,"funny":63,"cool":14,"fans":14,"elite":["2015","2017","2014","2016"],"average_stars":3.87,"compliment_hot":12,"compliment_more":5,"compliment_profile":1,"compliment_cute":0,"compliment_list":0,"compliment_note":9,"compliment_plain":7,"compliment_cool":17,"compliment_funny":17,"compliment_writer":8,"compliment_photos":8,"type":"user"}}
