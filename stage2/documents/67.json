Their deli food is dry and sandwich portions are meager. Tables improperly cleaned and sticky, food is starchy and canned-tasting, and it's loud and dilapidated. I've been here a few times and besides the awesome merry-go-round in front and some very impressive homemade toys, my experience has repeatedly been very disappointing. Staff are nice though.","useful":1,"funny":1,"cool":0,"type":"review","restaurant":{"name":"Ella's Deli","neighborhood":"Eken Park","address":"2902 E Washington Ave","city":"Madison","state":"WI","postal_code":"53704","latitude":43.1035133,"longitude":-89.344598,"stars":3.0,"review_count":214,"is_open":1,"attributes":["Alcohol: none","Ambience: {'romantic': False, 'intimate': False, 'classy': False, 'hipster': False, 'divey': False, 'touristy': True, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'casual': False}","BYOBCorkage: no","BikeParking: True","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards: True","BusinessParking: {'garage': False, 'street': False, 'validated': False, 'lot': True, 'valet': False}","Caters: True","GoodForKids: True","GoodForMeal: {'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': True, 'dinner': False, 'breakfast': False, 'brunch': False}","HasTV: False","NoiseLevel: loud","OutdoorSeating: False","RestaurantsAttire: casual","RestaurantsCounterService: False","RestaurantsDelivery: False","RestaurantsGoodForGroups: True","RestaurantsPriceRange2: 2","RestaurantsReservations: False","RestaurantsTableService: True","RestaurantsTakeOut: True","WheelchairAccessible: True","WiFi: no"],"categories":["Ice Cream & Frozen Yogurt","Local Flavor","Food","Burgers","American (Traditional)","Arts & Entertainment","Museums","Restaurants","Delis"],"hours":["Monday 10:0-21:0","Tuesday 10:0-21:0","Wednesday 10:0-21:0","Thursday 10:0-21:0","Friday 10:0-22:0","Saturday 10:0-22:0","Sunday 10:0-21:0"],"type":"business"},"user":{"name":"Kurt","review_count":303,"yelping_since":"2009-10-09","friends":["Rf730nsizp41XCIsHLjQeQ","iD7HFt90AyDEAIBVPg93og","fbpjEkaALuGJo_dCYWPYRQ","F1YlQcdyeZEQuMcL_nK2ew","E3xpr996watZyp6P0587Ow","BS3qOK1iRLcWtoV9KnwyXg","c_gbaITfVyG8i-NXS94KbA","Y8Idje-y71Uv2vj1UCoPBg","3iJdr8LdE6zhKQYRXRWQCA","RltxaRS89a5jtGW2KniNKQ","HZSTW4jHyWJY4hT5KBvZWw","YcmtCs2XKvWU0dv1L4tenw","4OxUH8nsKTKxILcsmaJHsQ","fwCUNnBrGCMr9dOrM45J5w","WNZfkL4DBspueoGSUOMAqA","Vhfq6EW4cTvsvJ_uFk61OQ","1xJwMqmvVXPwY7yEVQIc-A","Y3TecOUfkiQzPhuABA-G9Q","8IA3ZYlrW9xT4T1cm5fjvQ","UGvvZ2HVNxWm2kB9250diA","cufhYFdyrUAt4SWe-m0grQ","3mwqzfJCBbYSi_0Tpc_Abg"],"useful":50,"funny":19,"cool":25,"fans":7,"elite":["None"],"average_stars":4.02,"compliment_hot":0,"compliment_more":0,"compliment_profile":0,"compliment_cute":0,"compliment_list":0,"compliment_note":0,"compliment_plain":4,"compliment_cool":5,"compliment_funny":5,"compliment_writer":4,"compliment_photos":1,"type":"user"}}
