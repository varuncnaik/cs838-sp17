The portions are huge. I've never eaten here and not had left overs. My fiance and I usually get the <mango curry with tofu> and the <pad thai with chicken> and split them. The <pad thai> isn't like typical <pad thai> in that it's not heavy on the peanuts, but I like it. Last time we went, it was just the two of us and we didn't get anything to drink (just <water>) and the bill was about $18. Seriously, the prices are amazing. They have a HUGE menu -- it's actually a bit overwhelming, but should suit everyone's taste. Definitely try the appetizers. I've had all the various rolls, and they'll all good and of course, large portions.\n\nThe service is a bit slow, especially during peak dinner time. But, when the food comes out, it's always so hot and fresh so I never feel bad about waiting because I know the food quality is great.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review","restaurant":{"name":"Ha Long Bay Vietnamese & Thai Bistro","neighborhood":"Williamson - Marquette","address":"1353 Williamson St","city":"Madison","state":"WI","postal_code":"53703","latitude":43.0855448,"longitude":-89.3607155,"stars":4.0,"review_count":468,"is_open":1,"attributes":["Alcohol: beer_and_wine","Ambience: {'romantic': False, 'intimate': False, 'classy': False, 'hipster': False, 'divey': False, 'touristy': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'casual': True}","BikeParking: True","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards: True","BusinessParking: {'garage': False, 'street': True, 'validated': False, 'lot': False, 'valet': False}","Caters: False","GoodForKids: True","GoodForMeal: {'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': True, 'dinner': True, 'breakfast': False, 'brunch': False}","HasTV: False","NoiseLevel: average","OutdoorSeating: False","RestaurantsAttire: casual","RestaurantsDelivery: False","RestaurantsGoodForGroups: True","RestaurantsPriceRange2: 2","RestaurantsReservations: True","RestaurantsTableService: True","RestaurantsTakeOut: True","WheelchairAccessible: True","WiFi: no"],"categories":["Restaurants","Vietnamese","Thai"],"hours":["Monday 11:0-21:30","Tuesday 11:0-21:30","Wednesday 11:0-21:30","Thursday 11:0-21:30","Friday 11:0-21:30","Saturday 11:0-21:30","Sunday 11:30-21:0"],"type":"business"},"user":{"name":"Melissa","review_count":17,"yelping_since":"2010-11-21","friends":["wyBeaBxz-8IsW7L32WWEqA","7pEANW7-PxOlARhENksXbw","EvPVey9AM-47eh9QhcbVbQ","BPjDpLSWRnqj3drZFv5EwA","gBR-qNBcNGaRfKJr5mJ2gw","pSJdvpyt5OEIASbFtw0YMg"],"useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"fans":1,"elite":["None"],"average_stars":4.11,"compliment_hot":0,"compliment_more":0,"compliment_profile":0,"compliment_cute":0,"compliment_list":0,"compliment_note":0,"compliment_plain":0,"compliment_cool":0,"compliment_funny":0,"compliment_writer":0,"compliment_photos":0,"type":"user"}}
