Everything we ordered was straight-up phenomenal, but first, I want to rave about the service, because it was excellent.  Although we ordered 2 dishes at a time, they were delivered one by one, which was perfect - more than one dish would have been crowded for the tiny 2-seat table.  Pacing of the dishes and drinks?  Perfect.  I have some dietary restrictions that always leave me asking a lot of questions and making special requests;  the server was helpful, friendly, never made me feel like I was putting her out, and brought me plain <bread> when I needed to have some.\n\nBut now, the food.\n\nWe started with the <anchovies>, which were fantastic;  as my partner pointed out, they're difficult to do well, but these were done VERY well.  The description on the menu doesn't remotely do them justice.  Savory, salty deliciousness, with a touch of creamy garlic aioli.\n\nNext:  <piquillo peppers>, stuffed with a colorful mix of <roasted vegetables>, and served on a bed of <Israeli couscous salad>.  Not only was it very tasty, but it was substantial enough to have served as a light lunch on its own, at a mere $6.\n\nThird: <serrano-wrapped sea scallops>, with an orange pineapple vinaigrette.  I am not a scallop-lover;  I often find them rubbery.  These were perfectly-cooked and absolutely superb.\n\nFourth:  No way were we NOT trying the <grilled lamb>, and it was every bit as fantastic as previous reviewers have said.  Cooked perfectly rare, garnished with a port reduction - wonderful.  I couldn't eat the accompanying <manchego potato gratin>, but I was told that it was decadent.\n\nEverything else sounded so good that we undoubtedly would have eaten more if we possibly could have.  Cocktails and <wine> selection were also fantastic.  The prices are a bargain, for the quality of food, compared to what we're used to in Boston.  The decor and ambiance is quirky, not elegant, and it is a bit crowded, even when the place isn't full.  But we thought it was a fun, funky place to grab a bite (or four!), and we loved it!","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review","restaurant":{"name":"The Icon","neighborhood":"Capitol","address":"206 State St","city":"Madison","state":"WI","postal_code":"53703","latitude":43.0747755,"longitude":-89.3884537,"stars":3.5,"review_count":115,"is_open":1,"attributes":["Alcohol: full_bar","Ambience: {'romantic': False, 'intimate': False, 'classy': False, 'hipster': False, 'divey': False, 'touristy': False, 'trendy': True, 'upscale': False, 'casual': False}","BikeParking: True","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards: True","BusinessParking: {'garage': True, 'street': True, 'validated': False, 'lot': False, 'valet': False}","GoodForKids: False","GoodForMeal: {'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': False, 'dinner': True, 'breakfast': False, 'brunch': False}","HasTV: True","NoiseLevel: average","OutdoorSeating: True","RestaurantsAttire: casual","RestaurantsGoodForGroups: True","RestaurantsPriceRange2: 2","RestaurantsReservations: True","RestaurantsTableService: True","RestaurantsTakeOut: True","WheelchairAccessible: True","WiFi: free","Caters: True","RestaurantsDelivery: True","BusinessAcceptsBitcoin: False","DogsAllowed: False"],"categories":["Tapas Bars","Restaurants","Nightlife","Wine Bars","Bars"],"hours":["Tuesday 17:0-22:0","Wednesday 17:0-22:0","Thursday 17:0-2:30","Friday 17:0-2:30","Saturday 10:0-2:30","Sunday 16:0-22:0"],"type":"business"},"user":{"name":"Casey","review_count":7,"yelping_since":"2011-08-18","friends":["m_Fno_sUwygMD5NvkIuWgQ","-qMPPIyUxYMa0UZezcyn3A","CRWrmzAJpIJhsYeBpe573g"],"useful":1,"funny":1,"cool":1,"fans":1,"elite":["None"],"average_stars":3.86,"compliment_hot":0,"compliment_more":0,"compliment_profile":0,"compliment_cute":0,"compliment_list":0,"compliment_note":0,"compliment_plain":0,"compliment_cool":0,"compliment_funny":0,"compliment_writer":0,"compliment_photos":0,"type":"user"}}
