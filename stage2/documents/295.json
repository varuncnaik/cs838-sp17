She had been here to other times a couple weeks prior to that. I was very unimpressed with the Mexican food. It didn't taste authentic at all for a restaurant name that makes you think they would have really good Mexican food. We sat outside and had ok service but it wasn't anything spectacular and it wasn't a very busy Monday night either. My mom had two <margaritas> and couldn't drive home afterwards. So watch out for over pouring! I'm giving it three stars because the food was not spectacular by any means, same for the service, but the decorations set a nice ambience!","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review","restaurant":{"name":"Me & Julio","neighborhood":"","address":"2784 S Fish Hatchery Rd","city":"Fitchburg","state":"WI","postal_code":"53711","latitude":43.005696,"longitude":-89.426917,"stars":3.0,"review_count":66,"is_open":1,"attributes":["Alcohol: full_bar","Ambience: {'romantic': False, 'intimate': False, 'classy': False, 'hipster': False, 'divey': False, 'touristy': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'casual': True}","BikeParking: True","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards: True","BusinessParking: {'garage': False, 'street': False, 'validated': False, 'lot': True, 'valet': False}","Caters: True","GoodForKids: True","GoodForMeal: {'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': False, 'dinner': True, 'breakfast': False, 'brunch': False}","HasTV: True","OutdoorSeating: True","RestaurantsAttire: casual","RestaurantsDelivery: False","RestaurantsGoodForGroups: True","RestaurantsPriceRange2: 2","RestaurantsReservations: True","RestaurantsTableService: True","RestaurantsTakeOut: True","WheelchairAccessible: True","WiFi: free","NoiseLevel: average"],"categories":["American (Traditional)","Tex-Mex","Restaurants","Mexican"],"hours":["Monday 11:0-23:0","Tuesday 11:0-23:0","Wednesday 11:0-23:0","Thursday 11:0-23:0","Friday 11:0-1:0","Saturday 9:0-1:0","Sunday 9:0-23:0"],"type":"business"},"user":{"name":"Kaela","review_count":6,"yelping_since":"2015-03-29","friends":["None"],"useful":2,"funny":2,"cool":0,"fans":0,"elite":["None"],"average_stars":3.67,"compliment_hot":0,"compliment_more":0,"compliment_profile":0,"compliment_cute":0,"compliment_list":0,"compliment_note":0,"compliment_plain":0,"compliment_cool":0,"compliment_funny":0,"compliment_writer":0,"compliment_photos":0,"type":"user"}}
