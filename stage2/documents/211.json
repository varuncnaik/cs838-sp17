The Green Lantern surpassed my expectations.\n\nThe location is right on Lake Waubesa. There is a beautiful view out the window and after supper you can stroll down the pier and continue to admire the lake. The interior is divided into a pub area, the room with the window, and an extension below that. Lots of wood and lanterns -- it's cozy.\n\nThe hostess and especially our waitress were fun and friendly. She seemed to really enjoy her job.\n\nThe food is what sold us though. We each started w/a half dozen <oysters> on the half shell. These were shucked, no grit, still had their juice, decent sized and briny flavor. Served with a lemon wedges and a good sized portion of shrimp sauce. This is exactly how I want my <oysters> and the price was right.\n\nThere's no <salad> bar, but I enjoyed my <salad> which I ordered with blue cheese dressing. Often I'm disappointed with blue-cheese dressing and it just tastes like ranch, but this dressing was great. The blue cheese really shined. I also ordered the <rib-eye steak> and <baked potato>. The <steak> was perfectly cooked, tender, juicy, so delicious. No complaints about the potato nor the bread.\n\nAmbiance, service, great food, AND reasonable prices, I highly recommend the Green Lantern!","useful":3,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review","restaurant":{"name":"Green Lantern Restaurant","neighborhood":"","address":"4412 Siggelkow Rd","city":"Mc Farland","state":"WI","postal_code":"53558","latitude":43.0258026,"longitude":-89.3063407,"stars":3.5,"review_count":59,"is_open":1,"attributes":["Alcohol: full_bar","Ambience: {'romantic': False, 'intimate': False, 'classy': False, 'hipster': False, 'divey': False, 'touristy': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'casual': True}","BikeParking: True","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards: True","BusinessParking: {'garage': False, 'street': False, 'validated': False, 'lot': True, 'valet': False}","Caters: True","DogsAllowed: False","GoodForKids: True","GoodForMeal: {'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': False, 'dinner': True, 'breakfast': False, 'brunch': False}","HasTV: True","NoiseLevel: average","OutdoorSeating: False","RestaurantsAttire: casual","RestaurantsDelivery: False","RestaurantsGoodForGroups: True","RestaurantsPriceRange2: 2","RestaurantsReservations: True","RestaurantsTableService: True","RestaurantsTakeOut: True","WheelchairAccessible: True","WiFi: free"],"categories":["American (Traditional)","Restaurants"],"hours":["Monday 6:0-2:0","Tuesday 6:0-2:0","Wednesday 6:0-2:0","Thursday 6:0-2:0","Friday 6:0-2:0","Saturday 7:0-2:0","Sunday 7:0-2:0"],"type":"business"},"user":{"name":"Pat","review_count":111,"yelping_since":"2011-07-06","friends":["tToXubkeIoGvMFGM-l-mKw","fJ_qSZH_akvWzHUPMqab1g","XmUoErm8KkfP_ti71nXgAg","V0c-AS2FFCeSaV-3JfG5vA","VBzVK5URHshRSIjQpUARnQ","wd3xoNaDLib8dhQ7BxUl6g","aZNpAiVrtw8vdMJNb_Q0-Q","8teQ4Zc9jpl_ffaPJUn6Ew","GVuU1qYR_pWFEVezVjm8hQ","xK1rjIhV1qBx1NEXASeQXg","Q1IENmNc6bdDruACmhy4mg","mOanh--SkJagXdsfJU3wxQ","C__1BHWTGBNA5s2ZPH289g","RkzQJ--bwZaanE8JPYmIWA","NDfcFPPzHqvnCu9rEg2GfA","ii_VC2a9Gxvy7cOlUpfvrQ","LBGVtPFlxkzAWJPW5KhPNA","ub7N84t5J1hkfE-nE2BmBQ","BXuxdO-lBL4tdg1-AthsaQ"],"useful":6,"funny":0,"cool":6,"fans":3,"elite":["2017","2016"],"average_stars":3.85,"compliment_hot":7,"compliment_more":0,"compliment_profile":0,"compliment_cute":0,"compliment_list":0,"compliment_note":2,"compliment_plain":6,"compliment_cool":7,"compliment_funny":7,"compliment_writer":3,"compliment_photos":0,"type":"user"}}
