My father being 100% Italian and a fantastic chef was quite skeptical of the place at first. When we first walked in we noticed the fantastic old fashioned church atmosphere that would later compliment the food eloquently. We ordered appetizers that were relatively good. Our dinners, though, we're very good. My father very much enjoyed his <gamberi diavlo> and I also liked my <pollo Alfredo> a lot. The waitress was nice and it was super quite. The only down point I could see with the place is the slightly high prices. Other than that I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for good Italian food in Madison. \n\nNote: the place would be great for a date! \nDress somewhat nice.\nWhen we entered the waiter had to check and see if there was room for us even though it was close to empty and no one showed up for any reservations.
