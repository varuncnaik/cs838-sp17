Attentive service , yet unobtrusive--no \" hi, I'm Patel, your new best friend \" business--just genuine care and grace about your experience.\n\nAll dishes are served promptly (no worries, office park crowd)--in lovely crockery and china, with starched cloth napkins and substantial silverware--no sporks here--creating an atmosphere of grace and relaxation--even during a busy lunch hour. \nQuiet enough to hold a conversation without employing lipreading skills--another plus.\n\n(No typical Indian buffet scene to ensure you'll get the flu bug either.)\n\nDhaba also offers take out menu to consider for dinner when commuting home. \n\nBest <basmati rice> in town--all very reasonably priced.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review","restaurant":{"name":"Dhaba Indian Bistro","neighborhood":"","address":"8333 Greenway Blvd, Ste 100","city":"Middleton","state":"WI","postal_code":"53562","latitude":43.0898458,"longitude":-89.5265018,"stars":4.5,"review_count":160,"is_open":1,"attributes":["Alcohol: beer_and_wine","Ambience: {'romantic': False, 'intimate': False, 'classy': False, 'hipster': False, 'divey': False, 'touristy': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'casual': True}","BikeParking: True","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards: True","BusinessParking: {'garage': False, 'street': False, 'validated': False, 'lot': True, 'valet': False}","Caters: True","GoodForKids: True","GoodForMeal: {'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': True, 'dinner': True, 'breakfast': False, 'brunch': False}","HasTV: False","NoiseLevel: average","OutdoorSeating: True","RestaurantsAttire: casual","RestaurantsDelivery: True","RestaurantsGoodForGroups: True","RestaurantsPriceRange2: 2","RestaurantsReservations: True","RestaurantsTableService: True","RestaurantsTakeOut: True","WiFi: no"],"categories":["Restaurants","Indian","Vegetarian"],"hours":["Tuesday 11:0-15:0","Tuesday 17:0-22:0","Wednesday 11:0-15:0","Wednesday 17:0-22:0","Thursday 11:0-15:0","Thursday 17:0-22:0","Friday 11:0-15:0","Friday 17:0-22:0","Saturday 11:0-15:0","Saturday 17:0-22:0","Sunday 11:0-15:0","Sunday 17:0-22:0"],"type":"business"},"user":{"name":"GC","review_count":30,"yelping_since":"2010-12-29","friends":["None"],"useful":104,"funny":19,"cool":0,"fans":2,"elite":["None"],"average_stars":3.03,"compliment_hot":0,"compliment_more":0,"compliment_profile":0,"compliment_cute":0,"compliment_list":0,"compliment_note":0,"compliment_plain":1,"compliment_cool":0,"compliment_funny":0,"compliment_writer":0,"compliment_photos":0,"type":"user"}}
