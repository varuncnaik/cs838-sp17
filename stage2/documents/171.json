I had stopped by alone one afternoon and chatted with the owner. I was so impressed with his dedication to making his customers happy. Though it is hard to hear folks complaints he takes them to heart and does something about it. No arrogance just a commitment to excellence.\n\nI returned the Wednesday before Thanksgiving about 5 pm. We had no trouble finding a table but the place filled up quickly after our arrival. There were 5 of us and i had no trouble hearing over the din. The waitstaff was helpful and attentive. \n\nWe started with the <Crisps> (<strips of yam>) which were crunchy and delicious. I especially liked the herby chimmichuri sauce that accompanied the potatoes. I tasted bot the <White Onion Soup> and the <Butternut Squash soup>. The <squash soup> was the clear winner for me. I thought the <onion soup> was too cheesy (I am not a WI native) and lacked umami. The <squash soup> was sweet and delicate. Yum.\n\nMy sister and her husband stated that the <salmon sandwich> was good, not great. They are gourmands of sort so they may be mighty picky.\n\nI am not one to review <beer>. I like it but just do not know enough to rate it. The <Wilbur> was good but my brother-in-law preferred the <Willy>. That's all I know.\n\nI live close by and am sure to return. I want to try their <salads> and some other <beers>. My son did have an <Old Fashioned> and he liked it just fine. I enjoyed the neighborhood ambiance and the attitude of the the staff. \n\nI hope to add an extra star in the near future. Check back soon for an update.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review","restaurant":{"name":"Next Door Brewing Company","neighborhood":"Schenk - Atwood","address":"2439 Atwood Ave","city":"Madison","state":"WI","postal_code":"53704","latitude":43.093665,"longitude":-89.345698,"stars":3.5,"review_count":114,"is_open":1,"attributes":["Alcohol: beer_and_wine","Ambience: {'romantic': False, 'intimate': False, 'classy': False, 'hipster': False, 'divey': False, 'touristy': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'casual': True}","BikeParking: True","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards: True","BusinessParking: {'garage': False, 'street': True, 'validated': False, 'lot': True, 'valet': False}","Caters: False","GoodForKids: True","GoodForMeal: {'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': False, 'dinner': False, 'breakfast': False, 'brunch': False}","HasTV: True","NoiseLevel: average","RestaurantsAttire: casual","RestaurantsDelivery: False","RestaurantsGoodForGroups: True","RestaurantsPriceRange2: 2","RestaurantsReservations: True","RestaurantsTableService: True","RestaurantsTakeOut: True","WheelchairAccessible: True","WiFi: free","OutdoorSeating: True"],"categories":["Food","Bars","Breweries","Sandwiches","Restaurants","Nightlife","Pubs","American (New)"],"hours":["Monday 16:0-22:0","Tuesday 11:0-22:0","Wednesday 11:0-23:0","Thursday 11:0-23:0","Friday 11:0-0:0","Saturday 11:0-0:0","Sunday 11:0-21:0"],"type":"business"},"user":{"name":"Ami","review_count":113,"yelping_since":"2011-07-10","friends":["gOBemMfKRfpvJkz9OIw6aw","eujtZMdyJFxCbBoAZhcrEQ","aHrC3wjlpfVOn4vUA3HAKg","e9bVxMuG-1NIJWqT_pDEmQ","wW-ycw28MD5cJxU6KYOB2Q","ZNIn9PC0sHumZ0r5PG8tLQ","8teQ4Zc9jpl_ffaPJUn6Ew","GVuU1qYR_pWFEVezVjm8hQ","8ZLAklUl3vS9cnlwpv3v5g","uvRVutQ_Gu-OivL6ox0ouQ","KoY4KGxev8gdg5qQpyDlZA","24lYwNhWD0_n6ktX1HBQaA","XkXhvRmzyKzTaqXcmfAsXA","jL1TI1E0Yc0y-yQKCh307A","9M3gY85BdlzFidhQyA5o9A","NFxWUC2RX18YNZMaiFyb2Q","uWxmQNb3ZSZhzHd7MUl6XA","5ElMnvLAua7OtC7ft1fIlg","srFZ0_Q7ktL5USL63yzrHQ","nmEHRuUej_Tr5ozWHoAD3g","cA64mID-MyZXgp0SiExD8w","_UrgR8x-enYzt-XgnjJ3wQ","wd3xoNaDLib8dhQ7BxUl6g","LBGVtPFlxkzAWJPW5KhPNA","pWkjOMGcImS_Ta0LSZxydw","dlQePWQwcDPconG5b2E07g","_Thnvw6dXtng4l1zp5N45w","4q02ALXu_6i7-GWZAW9ctQ","ubfWMo99khiccOlyjujWKw","6DC0wklyCCirKpglOOCyow","HNycc5PctOiR2PXb-TFCIQ","dAdmWvykaBvtzHMaQTUomQ","RTWsMisf73pGnbagf1vmvg","KKvQ33m6Zhq5cbwnVshgdQ","TqKg5XonFWPAacSLpUNIVQ","hPNvRl4jAXsYoBAAhudRrA","tbycp0aRhRsiAVYUAVR_uQ","JUT0U3HTSB3kz9Wh7N0GqA","daqVIsrcbGYi4nzqyRnT2Q","pSYjXb62QotWzt4RKt56pw","WpuS4-OHZ62MMtEoJYm0og","o7XvmVNWL89972wg8vXV-Q","nT3tLANzGy0a7DuB_GIQjA","3S7cA5U-pGl1mC_9J0nTcw","M_UuEwc_HoqPhqgEzkjPrg","CH9VC7aLLsV8NFdaoU_uog","7JpPvfDAE_14vA1xgFOFjw","mUHJuirfyq3EsgNbhTkj2A","kzz4lKJl5b-Kqs6f_H7u3w","dYEHTYJeDJ4v8AUiExaVsw","arNzbnl_AVh7gpWhtXqyag","Jnx8GE372nbzljZ5VqZcGA","bNfxTKOdzqv7bj4Du_5LZg","FKclATu5-fmK6lsAUuHp7w","fJ_qSZH_akvWzHUPMqab1g","jwbcs_eQ2QznrOyMuqz1LQ","EXKDLuYoZUKUNNNYA7TlGQ","f7Emr9Q4H5r_jO_DW3QuIQ","NLyNvJ9LGG0DFAvUph97wQ","NwXV_WofVAmhZjfQvu6y0w","nODk_1cOo7Y6ceMyPN1iZw","PpWouvD4B31DP7eiPkD7Gw","d5WLqmTMvmL7-RmUDVKqqQ","MeDuKsZcnI3IU2g7OlV-hQ","6CzDXsYJNXLLbmDAaES4tQ","cDhs0eRMGtVVXzr5eiGiIQ","kS0J0v7cAKUmgfYIxPZEpw","adtOywpRnG5-4mjQMQE1FA","0lOSGSPpahLaJJKODrUTzQ"],"useful":86,"funny":15,"cool":35,"fans":10,"elite":["2017","2016","2015","2014","2013"],"average_stars":4.35,"compliment_hot":32,"compliment_more":3,"compliment_profile":1,"compliment_cute":0,"compliment_list":0,"compliment_note":29,"compliment_plain":27,"compliment_cool":53,"compliment_funny":53,"compliment_writer":26,"compliment_photos":3,"type":"user"}}
