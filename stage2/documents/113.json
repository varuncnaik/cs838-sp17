The ingredients are top-notch (try the pesto!) and the deep-dish crust is absolutely addictive; doughy, thick, and solid enough to hold all the toppings without breaking a sweat.  The thin crust is also quite good.  The <pizza> is never too greasy (unless, of course, you've gotten five meats and extra cheese), which is a major plus.\n\nThe <breadsticks> are excellent as well.  Buttery, sprinkled with Parmesan and cooked to perfection.  Falbo Bro's doesn't have the same wide selection of appetizers as, say, Glass Nickel, but all of their appetizers are solid.\n\nYou can also get <subs>, <salads>, or <Falzones> (get it!?  Falbo's <Calzones>!?) but why on earth would you get any of those things when you can have this godlike <pizza>?\n\nDelivery is efficient and I've never had any problems with the attitude of the drivers.  The person taking the orders is always friendly as well, but it's too bad that they don't have online ordering for this location.  The only other negative is the price; it's a little high for a place that's not striving to be \"gourmet\" <pizza> or whatever.  However, that's not enough for me to take off a star.  I've never been disappointed with the food I've gotten from Falbo's and they will always be my first choice for delivery in Middleton.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review","restaurant":{"name":"Falbo Bros.
