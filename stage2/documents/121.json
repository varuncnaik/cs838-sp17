It was okay. Not particularly bad, just nothing particularly redeeming that would make me go back. \nI also may be spoiled and used to variety of dishes on a Chicago tapas menus, but was quite surprised and disappointed when they didn't even have <paella>. \nMy husband and I both thought the <lamb meatballs> were good, and enjoyed the <tomato bread> but agreed the dish would have been better if the <bread> were toasted. The <gazpacho> was over blended and not very good, we only ate a few bites of it before giving up on the dish.The <mussels> were very neatly plated, and okay, maybe a bit salty, but with virtually no broth for dipping! That's my favorite part of <steamed mussels>. \nThe not particularly good food was also echoed in the drinks. My husband had a <Manhattan> (relabeled an <Ocean's 11>) that he said \"had too much vermouth.\"","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review","restaurant":{"name":"The Icon","neighborhood":"Capitol","address":"206 State St","city":"Madison","state":"WI","postal_code":"53703","latitude":43.0747755,"longitude":-89.3884537,"stars":3.5,"review_count":115,"is_open":1,"attributes":["Alcohol: full_bar","Ambience: {'romantic': False, 'intimate': False, 'classy': False, 'hipster': False, 'divey': False, 'touristy': False, 'trendy': True, 'upscale': False, 'casual': False}","BikeParking: True","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards: True","BusinessParking: {'garage': True, 'street': True, 'validated': False, 'lot': False, 'valet': False}","GoodForKids: False","GoodForMeal: {'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': False, 'dinner': True, 'breakfast': False, 'brunch': False}","HasTV: True","NoiseLevel: average","OutdoorSeating: True","RestaurantsAttire: casual","RestaurantsGoodForGroups: True","RestaurantsPriceRange2: 2","RestaurantsReservations: True","RestaurantsTableService: True","RestaurantsTakeOut: True","WheelchairAccessible: True","WiFi: free","Caters: True","RestaurantsDelivery: True","BusinessAcceptsBitcoin: False","DogsAllowed: False"],"categories":["Tapas Bars","Restaurants","Nightlife","Wine Bars","Bars"],"hours":["Tuesday 17:0-22:0","Wednesday 17:0-22:0","Thursday 17:0-2:30","Friday 17:0-2:30","Saturday 10:0-2:30","Sunday 16:0-22:0"],"type":"business"},"user":{"name":"Amber","review_count":48,"yelping_since":"2010-11-02","friends":["-7_MqVjXpiL2LzWgQGPb0w","zbKfKjFo0PCHqFODTmv7Cw","cPtEGIKaFdnWG6h1HZ8Wwg","HdlwaDK_i2VSki8UnDARbg","5EynFh_OJmln48Qzbznu7Q","ur5RJ2GFo3-CW5txOAZSxA","t7j7Lixj1RLZK7wtLsIsrg","XuiBAQi8lwPbHfKDgKWwEA","sV0A5Fnnk6ge8l56oIh9hQ","v1MFfe1n6wd_m9YBWUIQLw","U9qXWeJyDHklyqEg0cAj7w","42lu99SMGXyj3jeEwh0nSw","z4BbPLOsoAPb9biqIcfJIQ"],"useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":0,"fans":5,"elite":["2011"],"average_stars":3.52,"compliment_hot":0,"compliment_more":2,"compliment_profile":0,"compliment_cute":0,"compliment_list":0,"compliment_note":1,"compliment_plain":0,"compliment_cool":2,"compliment_funny":2,"compliment_writer":1,"compliment_photos":1,"type":"user"}}
