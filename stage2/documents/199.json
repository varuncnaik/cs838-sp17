It started with not being able to sit in the main room and we got taken down a long hall in a secluded room full of booths, with a loud fan and a dark, lonesome, secluded setting. The space between the table and bench is quite large so makes it awkward being so far from your food. The <spicy cheese bread> was about the only thing that gets a 3/4 star. Otherwise, the food was just crummy- <Mozzerella sticks>, <Cesar salad> (served with ginormous portions of dressing), <pizza> was bland with dry and hard crust and littler cheese and the <Monday pasta special> was just <pasta>, nothing special and could be made at home much better. Several of the <pasta> dishes came with very little sauce and the server came sparingly to check on us, and didn't even make it to run the check and we paid up front. The only thing that made this experience is being with family, and that was the point of going out for dinner!","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review","restaurant":{"name":"Paisan's","neighborhood":"Capitol","address":"131 W Wilson St","city":"Madison","state":"WI","postal_code":"53703","latitude":43.070715,"longitude":-89.383068,"stars":3.0,"review_count":125,"is_open":1,"attributes":["Alcohol: full_bar","Ambience: {'romantic': False, 'intimate': False, 'classy': False, 'hipster': False, 'divey': False, 'touristy': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'casual': True}","BYOB: False","BYOBCorkage: no","BikeParking: True","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards: True","BusinessParking: {'garage': True, 'street': False, 'validated': False, 'lot': False, 'valet': False}","Caters: False","GoodForKids: True","GoodForMeal: {'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': False, 'dinner': True, 'breakfast': False, 'brunch': False}","NoiseLevel: average","OutdoorSeating: True","RestaurantsAttire: casual","RestaurantsDelivery: False","RestaurantsGoodForGroups: True","RestaurantsPriceRange2: 2","RestaurantsReservations: True","RestaurantsTableService: True","RestaurantsTakeOut: True","WheelchairAccessible: True","WiFi: no","HasTV: True"],"categories":["Pizza","Restaurants","Italian"],"hours":["Monday 11:0-22:0","Tuesday 11:0-22:0","Wednesday 11:0-22:0","Thursday 11:0-22:0","Friday 11:0-23:0","Saturday 11:0-23:0","Sunday 11:0-22:0"],"type":"business"},"user":{"name":"Sarah","review_count":107,"yelping_since":"2013-04-09","friends":["hIFEU4u6EvnH26WEqQJYfw"],"useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"fans":0,"elite":["None"],"average_stars":3.7,"compliment_hot":0,"compliment_more":0,"compliment_profile":0,"compliment_cute":0,"compliment_list":0,"compliment_note":1,"compliment_plain":0,"compliment_cool":0,"compliment_funny":0,"compliment_writer":0,"compliment_photos":0,"type":"user"}}
