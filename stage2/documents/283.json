When we arrived on a Friday night there was a 45-50 minute wait, but with our reservation we got right in. The place was packed with lots of families with small children, so the noise level was high. We ordered the <deep fried mac and cheese> and the <Cheeseburger Pizza>. The <mac and cheese> is really good! It is made with pepper jack cheese, so it has a bit of a kick and then deep fried in Spotted Cow beer batter. They came out piping hot and were gone in minutes. The <pizza> was really good too. They have small plates, apps, <salads>, <sandwiches>, <pasta> and <pizza>, so not just a <pizza> place.\n\nKimberly was our server and she is GREAT. She handled our section efficiently and checked in several times with all tables. When I asked for more water, she brought a carafe! Tables were cleared immediately after they were vacated - nothing worse than looking at a table full of dirty dishes when you are eating. One table by us had 5 kids, so at the end of the meal the area looked like a disaster. She cleared it off, swept up the mess on the floor and it was like they had never been there. Hope the managers know what a great job she does.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review","restaurant":{"name":"Sugar River Pizza","neighborhood":"","address":"957 Liberty Dr","city":"Verona","state":"WI","postal_code":"53593","latitude":42.9726372452,"longitude":-89.5066787302,"stars":4.0,"review_count":48,"is_open":1,"attributes":["Alcohol: full_bar","Ambience: {'romantic': False, 'intimate': False, 'classy': False, 'hipster': False, 'divey': False, 'touristy': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'casual': True}","BikeParking: True","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards: True","BusinessParking: {'garage': False, 'street': False, 'validated': False, 'lot': True, 'valet': False}","Caters: True","GoodForKids: True","GoodForMeal: {'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': True, 'dinner': True, 'breakfast': False, 'brunch': False}","HasTV: True","NoiseLevel: average","OutdoorSeating: False","RestaurantsAttire: casual","RestaurantsDelivery: True","RestaurantsGoodForGroups: True","RestaurantsPriceRange2: 2","RestaurantsReservations: True","RestaurantsTableService: True","RestaurantsTakeOut: True","WheelchairAccessible: True","WiFi: free"],"categories":["Restaurants","Pizza","Comfort Food"],"hours":["Monday 11:0-22:0","Tuesday 11:0-22:0","Wednesday 11:0-22:0","Thursday 11:0-22:0","Friday 11:0-23:0","Saturday 11:0-23:0","Sunday 11:0-21:0"],"type":"business"},"user":{"name":"Nancy","review_count":113,"yelping_since":"2010-03-06","friends":["jMGn-9_NBffU-jvFlGk8Cg","e9bVxMuG-1NIJWqT_pDEmQ","ZPf2ii7OZpXD4cTxDTYU9A","wd3xoNaDLib8dhQ7BxUl6g","lVt5isSVIDo93xlH2JX2bA","GVuU1qYR_pWFEVezVjm8hQ","HNycc5PctOiR2PXb-TFCIQ","JUT0U3HTSB3kz9Wh7N0GqA","FKclATu5-fmK6lsAUuHp7w","LBGVtPFlxkzAWJPW5KhPNA","RO9qXHqWYS64V_qpZp7USQ","YAas95HTvCDtGIbTMy6BYQ","d5WLqmTMvmL7-RmUDVKqqQ","pgqoh3R5RqP18Er-Ieo17g","jodw0H9qMu7BaeErn8ORZg","3S7cA5U-pGl1mC_9J0nTcw","mUHJuirfyq3EsgNbhTkj2A","iqq1yl2u8D3Pe0PNTOU6hw"],"useful":133,"funny":10,"cool":3,"fans":3,"elite":["2017","2014","2012","2016","2015","2013"],"average_stars":3.67,"compliment_hot":16,"compliment_more":2,"compliment_profile":0,"compliment_cute":0,"compliment_list":0,"compliment_note":19,"compliment_plain":9,"compliment_cool":14,"compliment_funny":14,"compliment_writer":16,"compliment_photos":0,"type":"user"}}
