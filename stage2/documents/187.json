Fresh, made with care.  Had <the 'Original'>.... which the website says is based on the <muffaletta>... didn't know that.  Because friends and family have tossed around the idea of opening a Dairy Queen (yuck, but profitable) in Defo or other (independently owned, run) restaurant or food stop in Sun Prairie, it occurred to me that Sun Prairie needs a Schlotzky's and I feel it would do well here. So, I looked at their website. .... And happened to look at Nut Info.... wow, total heart attack maker food.  Probably not any worse than MacDonalds or something, but I thought this was better than Macdonalds etc.   Fresher, etc. \n\nAtmosphere, Marketing, Decor\n I way prefer the E. Wash Madison WI decor to that shown on website.  Pretty plain bldg, looks like a restaurant where the food is focus, not the latest marketing strategy.   Seems like east location could use a bit of something to 'soften the lines' a bit.... hard tile floors, chrome diner dining sets..... maybe some flowers on tables and landscaping or potted plants or planters to soften the beat up parking lot?   The franchise info says they encourage outdoor seating.... how bout it?  If they are trying to attract a customer like me, Schlotzky new bldg decor and marketing strategy / image featured on website is way on wrong track.   They spell everyting they can with a 'z' inztead of an 's' - my opinion, a poor attempt at being hip.  It all  looks like a cookie cutter fastfood / modern / crap.  Even the website is blah.  Dont like all the cartoonish blaring colors..  I will say it's easy to navigate though.\n\n Employees seemed a bit tire, bored, worn out and lackluster.  But My job sucks too, so I decided to chat up the grim guy who took my order and got a short if nice conversation and several smiles out of him.   \n\nThe E. Wash location is now in it's 19th year (when chatted up, the guy who took my order told me).  Schlotzky's online franchise info says contracts expire/renew at 20 yrs.....   Im guessing Schlotzky's Corporate feels Schlotzky's east needs to update to be worthy of renewal.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review","restaurant":{"name":"Schlotzsky's Deli","neighborhood":"Mayfair Park","address":"3825 E Washington Ave","city":"Madison","state":"WI","postal_code":"53704","latitude":43.1193287,"longitude":-89.3201096,"stars":3.5,"review_count":11,"is_open":0,"attributes":["Alcohol: none","Ambience: {'romantic': False, 'intimate': False, 'classy': False, 'hipster': False, 'divey': False, 'touristy': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'casual': True}","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards: True","BusinessParking: {'garage': False, 'street': False, 'validated': False, 'lot': True, 'valet': False}","Caters: True","GoodForKids: True","GoodForMeal: {'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': True, 'dinner': False, 'breakfast': False, 'brunch': False}","HasTV: False","NoiseLevel: average","OutdoorSeating: False","RestaurantsAttire: casual","RestaurantsDelivery: False","RestaurantsGoodForGroups: True","RestaurantsPriceRange2: 1","RestaurantsReservations: False","RestaurantsTableService: False","RestaurantsTakeOut: True"],"categories":["Delis","Restaurants"],"hours":["Monday 10:30-21:0","Tuesday 10:30-21:0","Wednesday 10:30-21:0","Thursday 10:30-21:0","Friday 10:30-21:0","Saturday 10:30-21:0","Sunday 10:30-20:0"],"type":"business"},"user":{"name":"Sarah","review_count":23,"yelping_since":"2009-02-07","friends":["None"],"useful":8,"funny":0,"cool":0,"fans":0,"elite":["None"],"average_stars":3.48,"compliment_hot":0,"compliment_more":0,"compliment_profile":0,"compliment_cute":0,"compliment_list":0,"compliment_note":1,"compliment_plain":2,"compliment_cool":0,"compliment_funny":0,"compliment_writer":0,"compliment_photos":0,"type":"user"}}
