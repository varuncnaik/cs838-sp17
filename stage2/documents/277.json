I had been up since 4:30 am and I need some good breakfast food.\n\nI have just moved to the east side of Madison, and noticed the crowd one Sunday morning at the Cottage Cafe....that many people could not be wrong.\n\nAnd I was not disappointed in the least.  The Cottage Cafe was what I thought it would be; a breakfast place first and foremost with a lunch offering.  I went simple with <eggs over medium>, <bacon> and a <pancake>.  The <pancake> is enormous!!  I will go smaller next time, but it was good.  <Eggs over medium> worked well. Served hot and delicious.  The <bacon> was cooked just right as well...crispy but not burnt.  <Coffee> cup never went empty.  Service was outstanding and friendly....smiles everyone...smiles!!!\n\nI will be back.  I will venture into the menu a little more.  But remember where you are going and what to expect; good, simple food cooked well.  Dine on my friends.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review","restaurant":{"name":"Cottage Cafe","neighborhood":"","address":"915 Atlas Ave","city":"Madison","state":"WI","postal_code":"53714","latitude":43.0852546,"longitude":-89.306513,"stars":4.5,"review_count":50,"is_open":1,"attributes":["Alcohol: none","Ambience: {'romantic': False, 'intimate': False, 'classy': False, 'hipster': False, 'divey': False, 'touristy': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'casual': True}","BikeParking: True","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards: True","BusinessParking: {'garage': False, 'street': False, 'validated': False, 'lot': True, 'valet': False}","Caters: False","GoodForKids: True","GoodForMeal: {'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': True, 'dinner': False, 'breakfast': True, 'brunch': True}","HasTV: False","NoiseLevel: average","OutdoorSeating: False","RestaurantsAttire: casual","RestaurantsDelivery: False","RestaurantsGoodForGroups: True","RestaurantsPriceRange2: 1","RestaurantsReservations: False","RestaurantsTableService: True","RestaurantsTakeOut: True","WheelchairAccessible: True","WiFi: no"],"categories":["Breakfast & Brunch","Restaurants","Cafes"],"hours":["Monday 6:0-14:0","Tuesday 6:0-14:0","Wednesday 6:0-14:0","Thursday 6:0-14:0","Friday 6:0-14:0","Saturday 6:0-14:0","Sunday 6:0-14:0"],"type":"business"},"user":{"name":"Bill","review_count":92,"yelping_since":"2013-10-23","friends":["NRMlDBUoGJdgoXTUllZpuA","vn6LELodEOlVasUp-e7fPw","-uUXMLwY73vr7lRSXvqRgQ","BLjZyMWF-K1rp94-MYT74w","CFlJ-eGxLZ3JYXILruCFHQ","fuSauctDVtNYQ0i7BmNyyg","BwfJx0BwTT34qhA0UOzgTw","0AK3HmJKCIFtCTKVat9WMA","zwJFI-Xh7Z8IYscRG-ozcQ","H2twH6nM-TBZQeTscT9DZA","CYFORhDqsJZGWzYGB1_MnQ","UfspYKxE2xiRWWAqiz8NaA","GwrCzcdeIRsgmc3jAHmeHw","lzDs6xBa7kOlzpDl24VHUA","wd3xoNaDLib8dhQ7BxUl6g","csqmnX2fHiTUS77VGfJrYQ","RLwKIqNV50a7GeG6JQ7-0g","9UJ9Sc1JCcAVrzObQhZ7lw","MAGM9oS4eOI5UH2sSdtpUg","tLbndVx3yogXInYlaCi70g","fJ_qSZH_akvWzHUPMqab1g","dzdfXv96XrUUl1d6lbK8Mg","WNk6R-aJaTEN7d-gwERfzg","cDhs0eRMGtVVXzr5eiGiIQ","5a3_PO3H78MN9Os_fd867A","gwnHUHFHIqdw-MioQ0T-KA"],"useful":11,"funny":1,"cool":0,"fans":4,"elite":["2017","2015","2016"],"average_stars":3.89,"compliment_hot":8,"compliment_more":1,"compliment_profile":0,"compliment_cute":0,"compliment_list":0,"compliment_note":8,"compliment_plain":3,"compliment_cool":7,"compliment_funny":7,"compliment_writer":3,"compliment_photos":0,"type":"user"}}
