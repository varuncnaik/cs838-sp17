A local review praised the quality and quantity of the food.  The best part of the <corned beef sandwich> was the bread.  At $9 for a Rueben, it should be worth $9.  When you take a bite of your sandwich, you shouldn't pull out the entire contents.  Large amounts of fat were included, at no charge.  Things they could do to improve ... Thinner slices and better trimmed meat and include a side for $9!","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review","restaurant":{"name":"Stalzy's Deli","neighborhood":"Schenk - Atwood","address":"2701 Atwood Ave","city":"Madison","state":"WI","postal_code":"53704","latitude":43.0937705,"longitude":-89.3452006,"stars":3.5,"review_count":70,"is_open":1,"attributes":["Alcohol: beer_and_wine","BikeParking: True","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards: True","BusinessParking: {'garage': False, 'street': False, 'validated': False, 'lot': True, 'valet': False}","Caters: True","GoodForKids: True","GoodForMeal: {'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': True, 'dinner': False, 'breakfast': False, 'brunch': False}","HasTV: False","NoiseLevel: average","OutdoorSeating: True","RestaurantsAttire: casual","RestaurantsDelivery: False","RestaurantsGoodForGroups: True","RestaurantsPriceRange2: 2","RestaurantsReservations: False","RestaurantsTableService: False","RestaurantsTakeOut: True","WheelchairAccessible: True","WiFi: free","Ambience: {'romantic': False, 'intimate': False, 'classy': False, 'hipster': False, 'divey': False, 'touristy': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'casual': True}"],"categories":["Delis","Bakeries","Breakfast & Brunch","Food","Restaurants"],"hours":["Tuesday 7:30-20:0","Wednesday 7:30-20:0","Thursday 7:30-20:0","Friday 7:30-21:0","Saturday 7:30-21:0","Sunday 7:30-16:0"],"type":"business"},"user":{"name":"Michael","review_count":17,"yelping_since":"2011-04-21","friends":["None"],"useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":1,"fans":2,"elite":["None"],"average_stars":2.89,"compliment_hot":1,"compliment_more":0,"compliment_profile":0,"compliment_cute":0,"compliment_list":0,"compliment_note":2,"compliment_plain":1,"compliment_cool":0,"compliment_funny":0,"compliment_writer":0,"compliment_photos":0,"type":"user"}}
