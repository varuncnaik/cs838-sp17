My family is Punjabi like the family that owns the restaurant, so I very much appreciated the mostly North Indian menu. \n\nFood: YUM! We have the <Non-Veg appetizer platter> (SO GOOD! <Keema Samosa> was one of the best I've had). We ordered <malai kofta>, <chicken tikka masala with garlic> and <chicken naan>. We later got some <Saag> (spinach dish) and <kheer>. \n\n<Naan> - We ended up trying garlic, chicken and plain naan. All kind were great! \n\n<Malai Kofta> - Best I've had in Madison. I've tried a few other places and they just don't hit the spot the way this one did. \n\n<Chicken Tikka Masala> - It's the only chicken dish I think is ever worth ordering at an Indian restaurant. This dish was literally designed for Indian restaurants, it's not authentic to India rather Great Britain.  So I don't bother with anything else. Dhaba's was reallllllly good!\n\n<Saag> - My mom licked the bowl she was so in love with it. \n\n<Kheer> -  I'm not someone who usually likes kheer but we had some at the end and I stole my mom's because it was just the perfect balance of sweet and creamy. \n\nWe ordered at a spice level 3 and found it perfect. I'm not someone that loves spicy food (ie. Hyderabi, Goan, Pakistani food.. I can't handle you) However, I do like some heat, so the 3 was honestly just perfect for my mom, sister and myself. My mom was even having a little bit of a hardtime handling that, but she's been cooking without much spice for the past year. \n\nRestaurant Decor: I really like how they've decorated it and appreciated the folk artwork and punjabi music playing in the background. Totally like a real 'Dhaba' (dhaba's are the Indian version of fast food joints... you pull over on the side of the road to a usually sheltered/tented area.. at least in Punjab & enjoy the whatever deep friend/sloppy delicacy you are offered... usually some sort of comfort food. Back to the review).\n\nOverall this place is awesome! I'm totally planning to cater for one of my wedding events from them! \n\nP.S. If you like Taste of India on Monroe street or Brookfield/Fox Valley, the owners family runs those locations as well. \n\nTWO THUMBS UP!","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review","restaurant":{"name":"Dhaba Indian Bistro","neighborhood":"","address":"8333 Greenway Blvd, Ste 100","city":"Middleton","state":"WI","postal_code":"53562","latitude":43.0898458,"longitude":-89.5265018,"stars":4.5,"review_count":160,"is_open":1,"attributes":["Alcohol: beer_and_wine","Ambience: {'romantic': False, 'intimate': False, 'classy': False, 'hipster': False, 'divey': False, 'touristy': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'casual': True}","BikeParking: True","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards: True","BusinessParking: {'garage': False, 'street': False, 'validated': False, 'lot': True, 'valet': False}","Caters: True","GoodForKids: True","GoodForMeal: {'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': True, 'dinner': True, 'breakfast': False, 'brunch': False}","HasTV: False","NoiseLevel: average","OutdoorSeating: True","RestaurantsAttire: casual","RestaurantsDelivery: True","RestaurantsGoodForGroups: True","RestaurantsPriceRange2: 2","RestaurantsReservations: True","RestaurantsTableService: True","RestaurantsTakeOut: True","WiFi: no"],"categories":["Restaurants","Indian","Vegetarian"],"hours":["Tuesday 11:0-15:0","Tuesday 17:0-22:0","Wednesday 11:0-15:0","Wednesday 17:0-22:0","Thursday 11:0-15:0","Thursday 17:0-22:0","Friday 11:0-15:0","Friday 17:0-22:0","Saturday 11:0-15:0","Saturday 17:0-22:0","Sunday 11:0-15:0","Sunday 17:0-22:0"],"type":"business"},"user":{"name":"Jess","review_count":93,"yelping_since":"2013-04-17","friends":["ZVt9zDGTSPaZVlAEdpSySg","k76JYeDWnkbdcwDbM8vJQQ","GFyA9ULGAeD-xZEPto2y7A","4lFES4hwX-ZLKSobUZS7sA","htmeKcGYnySh5lQTUaVzZw","DPptgtWH_GuaYEX8P2pW6w","hfOaPHm9zr3uS0Hj1P1r_A","46M8eJHQXcqeCBliJjGYDQ","TLP14XCwEOhAYsnlW6L9qA","gyxHa6MoYm6zm87RxubiIw","CbXQO1zpy2k_sazzQiV2IQ","G4RydTeMYv_VWvMCBF9U_Q","IeEC0Ij2VbbqUNrLfotJqw","7RcelaQwwUZMS4LcTgQLtA","BlC4VqRpmcGzOcQwt6MuJA","hVHq_6a-91hrsEscUMYK2w","U_zrzdnp-xGI4sfhjxGLcA","Q5getrPigiQiXdpFeo6QJg","KPgFydx5h3rfkcIg5vPV-g","MwCn_AbnBxbge1-4krEjiQ","9nfsxjHQfY8svSlXjuK31A","k1fk38ososc9xutvmhe-JA","LzFnYflQ53ct1aVYn2buyw","caICV2psm7OABEkikMx2vw","71c8Qg4Nzs4N73qYRzLh7w","3C3zSdJyals9cpa9meBz6Q","tQbjtI522EH76Kf3E4Fpww","YFNcxx6tY2LZQJAWPVYEig","jwbcs_eQ2QznrOyMuqz1LQ","pPxHK7z56QgFRn2aI_9dtA"],"useful":59,"funny":55,"cool":53,"fans":7,"elite":["2017","2016","2015"],"average_stars":3.88,"compliment_hot":2,"compliment_more":0,"compliment_profile":0,"compliment_cute":1,"compliment_list":0,"compliment_note":2,"compliment_plain":1,"compliment_cool":2,"compliment_funny":2,"compliment_writer":1,"compliment_photos":1,"type":"user"}}
