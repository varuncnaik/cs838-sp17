Sorry, but they can afford to renovate the place.\n\nBut their food is delish, their staff is INCREDIBLY attentive, and for some stroke of luck, everytime I go there for my birthday, the owner's best friend also is there in the next table, he orders a full <flourless chocolate cake> for him and his wife, not eating it all, and sees me and remembers that it's also my birthday, and orders me a <cake> and <champagne> too.\n\nOk, that's neither here nor there, but it's pretty cool that that happens.\n\nNO, I WILL NOT tell you when my birthday is... Hmph.. . You think I'm gonna divulge my secret?!??!?!\n\n*(hmphy, I wonder if that's already in the yelp info about me...
