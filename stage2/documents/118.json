He was the only server on a Friday night, so it obviously took a bit longer to get our food. However, we ordered an appetizer and small complimentary samples are provided for each table. That kept us entertained while food arrived. For being a busy Friday night, our food was made correctly and was delicious. Nice to see someone put his heart and soul into his work.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":1,"type":"review","restaurant":{"name":"K Peppers","neighborhood":"","address":"1901 Cayuga St, Ste 110","city":"Middleton","state":"WI","postal_code":"53562","latitude":43.0962004007,"longitude":-89.5136945802,"stars":3.5,"review_count":89,"is_open":1,"attributes":["Alcohol: beer_and_wine","Ambience: {'romantic': False, 'intimate': False, 'classy': False, 'hipster': False, 'divey': False, 'touristy': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'casual': True}","BikeParking: True","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards: True","BusinessParking: {'garage': False, 'street': True, 'validated': False, 'lot': True, 'valet': False}","GoodForKids: True","GoodForMeal: {'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': True, 'dinner': True, 'breakfast': False, 'brunch': False}","HasTV: False","NoiseLevel: average","OutdoorSeating: False","RestaurantsAttire: casual","RestaurantsDelivery: False","RestaurantsGoodForGroups: True","RestaurantsPriceRange2: 2","RestaurantsReservations: True","RestaurantsTableService: True","RestaurantsTakeOut: True","WheelchairAccessible: True","WiFi: no"],"categories":["Restaurants","Asian Fusion","Korean"],"hours":["Monday 17:0-20:30","Tuesday 11:0-14:0","Tuesday 17:0-20:30","Wednesday 11:0-14:0","Wednesday 17:0-20:30","Thursday 11:0-14:0","Thursday 17:0-20:30","Friday 11:0-14:0","Friday 17:0-20:30","Saturday 17:0-20:30"],"type":"business"},"user":{"name":"Julia","review_count":14,"yelping_since":"2013-06-19","friends":["C56a0lbsAGfkkfjCGo_V0g"],"useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":1,"fans":0,"elite":["None"],"average_stars":4.36,"compliment_hot":0,"compliment_more":0,"compliment_profile":0,"compliment_cute":0,"compliment_list":0,"compliment_note":1,"compliment_plain":0,"compliment_cool":0,"compliment_funny":0,"compliment_writer":0,"compliment_photos":1,"type":"user"}}
