This place has an interesting menu with lots of choices. The bike trail is right behind the place if you want to fortify yourself with a <Martini> halfway through your ride. I grew up a block from here on East Wilson so remember the place from fifty years ago. I know that Mickey was a black lab and thats where the name came from. Look over the bar and there are some rememders of him that you will not notice if I didn't mention it. So I did. You're welcome.  In those days they had a pier on the Yahara river which is just across the street, where boaters would tie up and go have a drink and get a six pack to go. The good old days. They have a back room that you might miss unless to go to the toilet and they have small bands here as well. Forget the brunch. Its too popular now and the wait can be long. It is good I just don't like waiting. My wife says Im a grouch, I say I'm just too busy to wait for breakfast. I have spoken.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review","restaurant":{"name":"Mickey's Tavern","neighborhood":"Williamson - Marquette","address":"1524 Williamson St","city":"Madison","state":"WI","postal_code":"53703","latitude":43.0878975,"longitude":-89.3587192,"stars":4.0,"review_count":169,"is_open":1,"attributes":["Alcohol: full_bar","Ambience: {'romantic': False, 'intimate': False, 'classy': False, 'hipster': True, 'divey': False, 'touristy': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'casual': True}","BestNights: {'monday': False, 'tuesday': False, 'friday': True, 'wednesday': False, 'thursday': True, 'sunday': False, 'saturday': True}","BikeParking: True","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards: False","BusinessParking: {'garage': False, 'street': True, 'validated': False, 'lot': False, 'valet': False}","Caters: False","CoatCheck: False","GoodForDancing: False","GoodForKids: False","GoodForMeal: {'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': False, 'dinner': True, 'breakfast': False, 'brunch': True}","HappyHour: True","HasTV: True","Music: {'dj': False, 'background_music': False, 'no_music': False, 'karaoke': False, 'live': True, 'video': False, 'jukebox': False}","NoiseLevel: loud","OutdoorSeating: True","RestaurantsAttire: casual","RestaurantsDelivery: False","RestaurantsGoodForGroups: True","RestaurantsPriceRange2: 1","RestaurantsReservations: False","RestaurantsTableService: True","RestaurantsTakeOut: True","Smoking: outdoor","WheelchairAccessible: False","WiFi: free"],"categories":["Nightlife","American (New)","Bars","Pubs","Sandwiches","Restaurants"],"hours":["Monday 11:30-2:0","Tuesday 11:30-2:0","Wednesday 11:30-2:0","Thursday 11:30-2:0","Friday 11:30-2:30","Saturday 9:0-2:30","Sunday 9:0-2:0"],"type":"business"},"user":{"name":"Loren","review_count":108,"yelping_since":"2015-01-02","friends":["wd3xoNaDLib8dhQ7BxUl6g","d5WLqmTMvmL7-RmUDVKqqQ"],"useful":4,"funny":4,"cool":1,"fans":0,"elite":["2017","2016"],"average_stars":3.96,"compliment_hot":1,"compliment_more":0,"compliment_profile":0,"compliment_cute":0,"compliment_list":0,"compliment_note":7,"compliment_plain":2,"compliment_cool":4,"compliment_funny":4,"compliment_writer":0,"compliment_photos":0,"type":"user"}}
