The <sushi> is decently good, but it does tend to pale in comparison to places where fresh seafood is more easily found (Chicago, San Francisco).  The non-sushi selections (Tonkatsu, <Tempura>) are filling and about what you'd expect (i.e. not modified to suit Western tastes) but don' t particularly stand out.\n\nService: Generally relatively speedy.  Servers are attentive but not in-your-face.\n\nValue: Reasonable prices, and portions fit the price.  Most entrees $12-30 range (haven't tried the <Hibachi>).  \n\nOverall: Reasonable value.  Average to good for Madison area, but somewhat middle of the road when compared to larger cities' options.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review","restaurant":{"name":"Takara","neighborhood":"","address":"696 S Whitney Way","city":"Madison","state":"WI","postal_code":"53774","latitude":43.0503272,"longitude":-89.4745296,"stars":3.5,"review_count":83,"is_open":1,"attributes":["Alcohol: full_bar","Ambience: {'romantic': False, 'intimate': False, 'classy': False, 'hipster': False, 'divey': False, 'touristy': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'casual': True}","BYOB: False","BYOBCorkage: no","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards: True","BusinessParking: {'garage': False, 'street': False, 'validated': False, 'lot': True, 'valet': False}","Caters: False","GoodForKids: True","GoodForMeal: {'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': True, 'dinner': True, 'breakfast': False, 'brunch': False}","HasTV: False","NoiseLevel: average","OutdoorSeating: False","RestaurantsAttire: casual","RestaurantsDelivery: False","RestaurantsGoodForGroups: True","RestaurantsPriceRange2: 2","RestaurantsReservations: True","RestaurantsTableService: True","RestaurantsTakeOut: True","WheelchairAccessible: True","WiFi: no","BikeParking: True"],"categories":["Restaurants","Sushi Bars","Japanese"],"hours":["Monday 11:0-14:30","Monday 16:30-22:0","Tuesday 11:0-14:30","Tuesday 16:30-22:0","Wednesday 11:0-14:30","Wednesday 16:30-22:0","Thursday 11:0-14:30","Thursday 16:30-22:0","Friday 11:0-14:30","Saturday 11:0-14:30","Sunday 13:0-22:0"],"type":"business"},"user":{"name":"Utena","review_count":17,"yelping_since":"2008-04-28","friends":["None"],"useful":6,"funny":0,"cool":0,"fans":0,"elite":["None"],"average_stars":3.18,"compliment_hot":0,"compliment_more":0,"compliment_profile":0,"compliment_cute":0,"compliment_list":0,"compliment_note":0,"compliment_plain":0,"compliment_cool":0,"compliment_funny":0,"compliment_writer":1,"compliment_photos":0,"type":"user"}}
