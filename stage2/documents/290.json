I first thought the prices were very high ($10.99 for my terrible <sweet and sour pork>).  My buddy got very spicy chicken.  We both got a bowl of <white rice>, and we had to buy our own drinks.  I went to pay for us with my American Express card, and the little Chinese woman said they don't take it because it cost them 6%, which I know is a lie.  \nThe sweet and sour arrived - No pineapple, just a few strips of vegetables, The pork was a thin strip, like bacon, heavily breaded and deep fried.  Tasted terrible.  The restaurant only had plastic silverware, and I had to ask the little Chinese woman for real silverware - Which was dirty - Not well washed and shiny.\nI couldn't finish my lunch, and my buddy only had a couple of pieces of the pork - He didn't like it either.\nI will never go back to that place - Sterile atmosphere, high prices horrible food, lying staff, do not take AMEX.  The whole place was dirty and cheap.  The whole meal cost $25.30 for the two of us - Could have purchased a much finer meal at Hong Kong Cafe for about $12 - $14 for the two of us.  \nI cannot recommend this place at all.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":1,"type":"review","restaurant":{"name":"Double 10","neighborhood":"","address":"3306 University Ave","city":"Madison","state":"WI","postal_code":"53705","latitude":43.0756343,"longitude":-89.4446351,"stars":4.0,"review_count":68,"is_open":0,"attributes":["Alcohol: none","Ambience: {'romantic': False, 'intimate': False, 'classy': False, 'hipster': False, 'divey': False, 'touristy': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'casual': True}","BikeParking: True","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards: True","BusinessParking: {'garage': False, 'street': False, 'validated': False, 'lot': True, 'valet': False}","Caters: True","GoodForKids: True","GoodForMeal: {'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': True, 'dinner': False, 'breakfast': False, 'brunch': False}","HasTV: False","NoiseLevel: quiet","OutdoorSeating: False","RestaurantsAttire: casual","RestaurantsDelivery: True","RestaurantsGoodForGroups: False","RestaurantsPriceRange2: 1","RestaurantsReservations: False","RestaurantsTableService: False","RestaurantsTakeOut: True","WiFi: no"],"categories":["Restaurants","Food Delivery Services","Food","Chinese"],"hours":["Monday 11:0-22:0","Tuesday 11:0-22:0","Wednesday 11:0-22:0","Thursday 11:0-22:0","Friday 11:0-22:0","Saturday 11:0-22:0","Sunday 11:0-22:0"],"type":"business"},"user":{"name":"M","review_count":14,"yelping_since":"2014-07-14","friends":["x1triIyy-bFFcFsdixnxxg","r6gP3_aby-PB-txI5tbsFQ"],"useful":0,"funny":1,"cool":0,"fans":0,"elite":["None"],"average_stars":2.25,"compliment_hot":0,"compliment_more":0,"compliment_profile":0,"compliment_cute":0,"compliment_list":0,"compliment_note":2,"compliment_plain":0,"compliment_cool":0,"compliment_funny":0,"compliment_writer":0,"compliment_photos":0,"type":"user"}}
