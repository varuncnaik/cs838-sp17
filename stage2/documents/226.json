The service was fantastic, he was prompt and friendly with decent <beer> knowledge. The <beer taps> were all unique and there was a large variety of them, so <craft beer> drinkers should be able to find something that they like. We all ordered from the <sandwich> menu as no one in our group was a big brunch person, and the consensus was that the food was decent quality. I had the <chicken sandwich>, my husband had the <brisket>, and my dad had the <Craftsman Burger>. We all walked away satisfied and full! The atmosphere was nice but casual, would be a good place to spend a happy hour with friends during the week!","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review","restaurant":{"name":"Craftsman Table & Tap","neighborhood":"","address":"6712 Frank Lloyd Wright Ave","city":"Middleton","state":"WI","postal_code":"53562","latitude":43.106774,"longitude":-89.4977379,"stars":3.5,"review_count":157,"is_open":1,"attributes":["Alcohol: full_bar","Ambience: {'romantic': False, 'intimate': False, 'classy': False, 'hipster': False, 'divey': False, 'touristy': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'casual': True}","BikeParking: True","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards: True","BusinessParking: {'garage': False, 'street': True, 'validated': False, 'lot': False, 'valet': False}","Caters: False","GoodForKids: True","GoodForMeal: {'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': False, 'dinner': True, 'breakfast': False, 'brunch': False}","HasTV: True","NoiseLevel: average","OutdoorSeating: True","RestaurantsAttire: casual","RestaurantsDelivery: False","RestaurantsGoodForGroups: True","RestaurantsPriceRange2: 2","RestaurantsReservations: True","RestaurantsTableService: True","RestaurantsTakeOut: True","WheelchairAccessible: True","WiFi: free"],"categories":["American (Traditional)","Gastropubs","Restaurants"],"hours":["Monday 11:0-23:0","Tuesday 11:0-23:0","Wednesday 11:0-23:0","Thursday 11:0-23:0","Friday 11:0-0:0","Saturday 8:0-0:0","Sunday 8:0-23:0"],"type":"business"},"user":{"name":"Allie","review_count":103,"yelping_since":"2014-09-01","friends":["i6yRdeF_yHUXGZeW4Ajuow","HNycc5PctOiR2PXb-TFCIQ","tIyyG7Pa_Fk3oW8P4ppMjg","Ew5ogtC-fUfyUddUqvbN4w","aHiLmgQMMwZR0B49t8ek0w","Ak6oVtuj1PS0eU44HXiryQ","-kzDnGOxF8pVCp_oo7s2Ww","U7sj7oS-rotdKQiwrWYeSw","3MH98JxTJ4DaSy6bPkj-ng","WdEmkh_nJHcKz5dre79JZA","j3zwsRH7ujNaud1czraX1A","Nyrt6FrFySCBlwqihABCvg","7fJdnu7Oea0eoSdaSPKTSw","mzNFGcXi0ragzGTHggRSIA","3UsqCg3-gDrhCw8jn6n-YA","W2hkwdTjuF2ISV2Jd8F8ww","fJ_qSZH_akvWzHUPMqab1g","wm61ALFiZ-7BCbX57evHPw","p4OrF6YtQdEIKRc_ELZwEg","G9Li9UvO1C5vN3bGe6mQGw","1gcQEtwsS3VYV9L6pQYT7w","OD4BXJa12g2JgYf-RMZvtA","jGDmxdMlVw3dDzMbtDrvXQ","kzz4lKJl5b-Kqs6f_H7u3w","3QhEjt7RHDXlw6mE2ZQjNQ","OSZrbNaEpLMTg3akiLqQxA","SEZVQUIxNukcowUAR14VUQ","VAiyaVsPLI_LYUl7nMyORg","gAgWSbKqHjGWnyZVI1GNuw","FQSpfdFs9L7hvSYBWkO_mw","ucr_lUJbc2lKqZO_a8-L8Q","eAtFxGAysAk3ib5o4kTJ2Q","Ln77OC2O_bsUGUF2m7P6ZA","Rt7hZnqisciytNSX_owpwA","5TgA3YNBb3JsIy-LKfjrlQ","JOGMYfScdXuZt5Cq0K5tIg","IDycJ7ocCWah9UWElZppWA","nqVqqYyATqEgixyvueS8BA","RYxNeupZW4H_LUmyme3AVQ","Vd0pdbXtbKchSyEkj70nRg","d5WLqmTMvmL7-RmUDVKqqQ","no7xn66WrNPx1r5UuUO_sA","5VDCZpG-AitRGS5C8I7ZZA","UKtCancQ_ozblkiqCwcOjQ","CgCXAa7r1fzAFsa7gc6q4w","IS6EtaFdpkw0EWLVxXXMwQ","pq-0jYZ-EFVmCo7Ln_oSmA","FKclATu5-fmK6lsAUuHp7w","JRje3CAM_OA2TKZ_F35pcQ","v99WIvJF6SYWuJIkoMJr5Q","-8no2HGbPBy8HsQeSFTUSQ","AKRDm8W-6zmQXvmZovGtjw","ejbGKK2Oyb-cbSiwwXbxSg","C6xHEN3g3H3Xy2NpMamdmg","c8R-7mn3lKDd9Efze5Zw0g","b6-8P7YvFXPdmYqWTOZT-w","k5H50uchaTGX3EMqU4jWkQ","PT04OWw-aM547f3EvzLXig","jL1TI1E0Yc0y-yQKCh307A","caICV2psm7OABEkikMx2vw","f69OAVkil-DU-jybv-F26g","pfJF9gu6GkeLV1WiMaVGig","aMlULK-TlX32L1eX9arhGQ","_UO_aGoQeGSHY0rOhNGepA","Amsx-txMM5Cu7GLyltxnYA","wd3xoNaDLib8dhQ7BxUl6g","1ZDL3ewrk5UaQmaJZDJJaQ","lWF-OBJ8uaPVqCAOjZDcsw","-AoVtFs_MUX-xgbP2Ojd_Q","O5KJSG_Rvoe1Lg474dfLdg","UmUg-icUSshRlhCImz7KAA","KImDfKRpLV1vv7in15gehg","a6PCvaTXTYEWUdijiSTXvg","JrFAHZNTZaoXnt4a1w6nQA","8teQ4Zc9jpl_ffaPJUn6Ew","ur60XEiTUVZqtRKmKBX7Dw","G7sO7DwTS4b2zzZd-4Itzw"],"useful":10,"funny":0,"cool":1,"fans":2,"elite":["2015","2016","2017"],"average_stars":4.13,"compliment_hot":8,"compliment_more":1,"compliment_profile":0,"compliment_cute":0,"compliment_list":0,"compliment_note":8,"compliment_plain":5,"compliment_cool":15,"compliment_funny":15,"compliment_writer":3,"compliment_photos":1,"type":"user"}}
