First off the bartender was one of the worst. A tall guy who looked out of place here in Middleton with his dirty jeans and jersey shirt. He also had no clue on bartending. He walked by our part of the bar twice with us waiving and didn't even look up. We finally had to YELL at him to get his attention. Later he didn't notice three of us needed refills and we decided to wait until we were seated to order another drink. Bad first impression. The good is that the waitstaff at the tables was very attentive and the food was very good.I had the <ribs and chicken> dinner. Perfectly done and served with some good <coleslaw> and <mashed potatoes>. The <ribs> could have used a little something to add some kick to it but all in all pretty good. Others at our table had <pasta> dishes that passed the test as well. Without the bar experience I still say give this place a chance. We need more restaurants on this side of town.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review","restaurant":{"name":"Cold Fusion","neighborhood":"","address":"2644 Branch St","city":"Middleton","state":"WI","postal_code":"53562","latitude":43.1037526,"longitude":-89.4930547,"stars":3.5,"review_count":11,"is_open":0,"attributes":["Alcohol: full_bar","Ambience: {'romantic': False, 'intimate': False, 'classy': False, 'hipster': False, 'divey': False, 'touristy': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'casual': False}","BikeParking: True","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards: True","BusinessParking: {'garage': False, 'street': False, 'validated': False, 'lot': False, 'valet': False}","Caters: False","GoodForKids: False","GoodForMeal: {'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': False, 'dinner': False, 'breakfast': False, 'brunch': False}","HasTV: True","NoiseLevel: average","OutdoorSeating: True","RestaurantsAttire: casual","RestaurantsDelivery: False","RestaurantsGoodForGroups: True","RestaurantsPriceRange2: 2","RestaurantsReservations: False","RestaurantsTakeOut: True","WiFi: free"],"categories":["Restaurants","Asian Fusion","American (Traditional)"],"hours":["Monday 11:0-2:0","Tuesday 11:0-2:0","Wednesday 11:0-2:0","Thursday 11:0-2:0","Friday 11:0-2:0","Saturday 11:0-2:0","Sunday 11:0-2:0"],"type":"business"},"user":{"name":"Loren","review_count":108,"yelping_since":"2015-01-02","friends":["wd3xoNaDLib8dhQ7BxUl6g","d5WLqmTMvmL7-RmUDVKqqQ"],"useful":4,"funny":4,"cool":1,"fans":0,"elite":["2017","2016"],"average_stars":3.96,"compliment_hot":1,"compliment_more":0,"compliment_profile":0,"compliment_cute":0,"compliment_list":0,"compliment_note":7,"compliment_plain":2,"compliment_cool":4,"compliment_funny":4,"compliment_writer":0,"compliment_photos":0,"type":"user"}}
