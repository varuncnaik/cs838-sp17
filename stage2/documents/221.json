I had breakfast today and very little was good about it. I feel bad because of all the good memories, Its too bad this wasnt one of them.\n\nService - Fair to good. Our waitress was very busy but attentive and nice. Food came out hot and punctual.\n8/10\n\nFood Quality - Ok, heres where I might hurt feelings. I ordered the <Steak and Eggs>. The goods: <Bacon> was crunchy and hot, and the <pancakes> albeit much smaller then I remember tasted great. Lots of butter.\nThe bads: Everything else. The eggs were not scrambled, they were formed into a patty. The <hashbrowns> with cheese on top had a weird aftertaste (kind of bitter, soapy or something), and the <steak>, oh my god, was THE worst <steak> Ive ever attempted to eat. I am a <steak> fanatic so its my bad that I thought Perkins might suprise me (like Norms diner in LA, great t bone there). Nope, it was tough, tasted gamey, and soooo chewy. I spent so much time chewing everything else went cold. It was cooked to my liking its just they have horrible cuts of meat.\n2/10 (0/10 without <bacon> and <pancakes>)\n\nPrice - For what I got not good at all. I paid $12 for <\"steak\" and eggs> and $3 for a side of <bacon> (4 strips). Coffee was priced well. I expect either a smaller <steak> of better quality then the 7oz piece of garbage I got.\n1/10\n\nExperience/Vibe - Typical of any Perkins, we weren't offered to have a booth which I think is a no brainer, some people prefer booths. A little cramped but not too bad.\n6/10\n\nOverall - 17/40\n\nMANAGEMENT PLEASE LISTEN!!!\nPlease your meat elsewhere. Ive never had such a tough piece of <\"steak\"> in my life. I am anti A1 sauce cause I like the taste of <steak> as it is. I actually used A1 because of how nasty I felt trying to choke this down. I can't believe you call that <steak>, the only way I will ever buy that false <steak> again is if the world ran out of dog food and my dog was starving. Even then Id feel bad for my dog and probably end up giving him the hiemlich maneuver after choking on it.\n\n1 star, sorry Perkins, you might have just lost a customer to Dennys. Ill still patronize your bakery but as for meals I think I am done. Hire a meat manager or fire the one you have, please.","useful":1,"funny":1,"cool":0,"type":"review","restaurant":{"name":"Perkins Restaurant & Bakery","neighborhood":"","address":"1410 Damon Rd","city":"Madison","state":"WI","postal_code":"53713","latitude":43.0352128,"longitude":-89.4078011,"stars":3.0,"review_count":29,"is_open":1,"attributes":["Alcohol: none","Ambience: {'romantic': False, 'intimate': False, 'classy': False, 'hipster': False, 'divey': False, 'touristy': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'casual': False}","BikeParking: False","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards: True","BusinessParking: {'garage': False, 'street': False, 'validated': False, 'lot': True, 'valet': False}","Caters: False","GoodForKids: True","HasTV: False","NoiseLevel: average","OutdoorSeating: False","RestaurantsAttire: casual","RestaurantsDelivery: False","RestaurantsGoodForGroups: True","RestaurantsPriceRange2: 2","RestaurantsReservations: False","RestaurantsTableService: True","RestaurantsTakeOut: True","WheelchairAccessible: True","WiFi: no","GoodForMeal: {'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': False, 'dinner': False, 'breakfast': True, 'brunch': True}"],"categories":["Diners","Restaurants","American (Traditional)","Breakfast & Brunch","Cafes","Food","Bakeries"],"hours":["Monday 0:0-0:0","Tuesday 0:0-0:0","Wednesday 0:0-0:0","Thursday 0:0-0:0","Friday 0:0-0:0","Saturday 0:0-0:0","Sunday 0:0-0:0"],"type":"business"},"user":{"name":"Mickey","review_count":5,"yelping_since":"2012-07-31","friends":["None"],"useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0,"fans":0,"elite":["None"],"average_stars":3.0,"compliment_hot":0,"compliment_more":1,"compliment_profile":0,"compliment_cute":0,"compliment_list":0,"compliment_note":0,"compliment_plain":1,"compliment_cool":0,"compliment_funny":0,"compliment_writer":0,"compliment_photos":0,"type":"user"}}
