The Church Key's crowds resemble a Mumbai street market (except with frat boys instead of Indians) on any weekend night, and even on most Thursdays. \n\nWhile I've never actually had a terrible experience here, I've never had a memorable one either. There really isn't anything that makes the Church Key stand out from any other campus bar, in terms of selection, prices, staff, features, decoration, or anything else a good bar excels at. Drinks are pretty overpriced. Given its extreme average-ness, The Church Key doesn't really offer any specials that would ever make me want to go out of my way to get a drink here any night of the week.","useful":1,"funny":1,"cool":0,"type":"review","restaurant":{"name":"Churchkey Bar and Grill","neighborhood":"Capitol","address":"626 University Ave","city":"Madison","state":"WI","postal_code":"53715","latitude":43.0734676,"longitude":-89.3970368,"stars":3.5,"review_count":19,"is_open":1,"attributes":["Alcohol: full_bar","Ambience: {'romantic': False, 'intimate': False, 'classy': False, 'hipster': False, 'divey': False, 'touristy': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'casual': True}","BikeParking: False","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards: True","CoatCheck: False","GoodForDancing: True","HappyHour: True","HasTV: True","NoiseLevel: loud","OutdoorSeating: False","RestaurantsGoodForGroups: True","RestaurantsPriceRange2: 1","Smoking: no"],"categories":["American (Traditional)","Restaurants","Bars","Nightlife"],"hours":["Tuesday 19:0-2:0","Wednesday 11:0-2:0","Thursday 11:0-2:0","Friday 11:0-2:30","Saturday 19:0-2:30"],"type":"business"},"user":{"name":"S","review_count":200,"yelping_since":"2010-06-22","friends":["KxaQND1ATI35Qlu2gGBhCw","fZ3x04Q3g-FGusq-TFfmlQ","yW9QjWY0olv5-uRKv3t_Kw","YpBcbsY6cSYbZQnVv6DFYQ","UB-_PrBWeqDdeAs8xGrRTQ","UxQTi1nyMDEkHlObXNLKyw","JUT0U3HTSB3kz9Wh7N0GqA","c4K7qUR-1CDnl-UuZRUn5A","9SWtEX1k9AjRg93BAzMCpg"],"useful":19,"funny":33,"cool":9,"fans":5,"elite":["None"],"average_stars":3.13,"compliment_hot":1,"compliment_more":1,"compliment_profile":0,"compliment_cute":0,"compliment_list":0,"compliment_note":3,"compliment_plain":3,"compliment_cool":0,"compliment_funny":0,"compliment_writer":7,"compliment_photos":0,"type":"user"}}
