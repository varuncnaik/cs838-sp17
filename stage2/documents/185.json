Those of you familiar with Kim's Noodles know the space. Rosie's is doing some good things with it--including a fireplace nook that appears to be waiting to be loaded with books. The bar has been turned into a, well, <coffee> bar. \n\nThe <coffee> itself was delicious. That is always an important thing for me, and this was as good as any downtown <coffee> shop. I grabbed a box of <donuts>, which were a hit with staff here at work. I'll have to try other items soon. \n\nThey also do <cakes> for special occassions.","useful":4,"funny":0,"cool":1,"type":"review","restaurant":{"name":"Rosie's Coffee Bar & Bakery","neighborhood":"Lake Edge","address":"4604 Monona Dr","city":"Madison","state":"WI","postal_code":"53716","latitude":43.0698651234,"longitude":-89.3257421745,"stars":4.0,"review_count":70,"is_open":1,"attributes":["Alcohol: none","Ambience: {'romantic': False, 'intimate': False, 'classy': False, 'hipster': False, 'divey': False, 'touristy': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'casual': True}","BikeParking: True","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards: True","BusinessParking: {'garage': False, 'street': False, 'validated': False, 'lot': True, 'valet': False}","Caters: True","GoodForKids: True","GoodForMeal: {'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': False, 'dinner': False, 'breakfast': True, 'brunch': True}","HasTV: False","NoiseLevel: quiet","OutdoorSeating: False","RestaurantsAttire: casual","RestaurantsDelivery: False","RestaurantsGoodForGroups: True","RestaurantsPriceRange2: 1","RestaurantsReservations: False","RestaurantsTableService: True","RestaurantsTakeOut: True","WiFi: free"],"categories":["Coffee & Tea","Food","Restaurants","Breakfast & Brunch","Bakeries"],"hours":["Monday 6:30-16:0","Tuesday 6:30-16:0","Wednesday 6:30-16:0","Thursday 6:30-16:0","Friday 6:30-16:0","Saturday 7:0-15:0","Sunday 8:30-13:30"],"type":"business"},"user":{"name":"Jody","review_count":112,"yelping_since":"2010-01-31","friends":["8ZLAklUl3vS9cnlwpv3v5g","yc45X4AC01JBkXUuk5CevA","r-Rtt-CYcZrx1cm4_AtL6Q","OnxTm5gfzAYO6S8Qy0ylwg","gBDlGjiopSewwtsCVUz24Q","MCrmem49pxwaKBAA8riRwA","h81BqSHPQvLww-Jcz_ZXHA","pOdftjggDSyu9XXWe1nGUQ","xKjdAb6cK3T0I2_lJepzTA","LBGVtPFlxkzAWJPW5KhPNA","qbdUJ1TAmkztEPQngLIy2Q","kJtrgFyQ01L12DiQgtHSyA","SqcWFTClaLjYQ4GZR6YsNQ","SHrdNZh7B5o6dpYPJjIJNQ","HNycc5PctOiR2PXb-TFCIQ","1fPfdflD1PthFV56WnSJIw","mFoyCL5_T0jJnSRNyyeblA","tuYMK1U_uUtf8TgpJ0c9dQ","gkd8_pCTIaUtPxjtBrlHkg","xLU5UNpu1n9vNPJurfcWBw","MMh75ZOKH1bXDE8UqTOLjw","wd3xoNaDLib8dhQ7BxUl6g","wjtTbTo8Lq8eNhsrMlawjg","RmjrAOxVW3wRrzAmg4WQ3A","EXLFF7M-DprDtE9PIwX_wQ","LYU74yOIYjtwgdg813BiWQ","QrlLbsYSA1gsJegMxo3oqw","pwx4mSkaFvJqjG8j5C59kA","8rXmutnJUqACRvdGGDNfIg","17nGS8uFwtrUJSWEUqfHOA","cy91v8bn79Qai6M8UIkrOw","Jnqo0o3WaYIsNVvBAxRCYA","14kyulI7izXYbjhfYxABGQ","fuoYjsuU7qy1RlCMEZ0xfA","P1SflOdcUTbfyyCOp4eAnA","jGvOfQVDz_UB6RVf3Vs5EA","0qCclQ4dhbJ-7_1j1jpemg","-Vof3astF2mh_StFIPIicg","epyCmzzy6pAKbchWsJltUQ","JQhOnIgDALdsXQkUwk7Z0A","p86Y1U952uoeygSYI9i1QA","QJemUZityFfiYBmwsPcQTw","gNyQ8VrJbRhJ9Iiiqi5wqQ","rJETt6FYI79JI2JsEsR52g","DEOH_z7QaXnrH7vnmDl5KA"],"useful":14,"funny":4,"cool":12,"fans":5,"elite":["2016","2017"],"average_stars":3.91,"compliment_hot":8,"compliment_more":1,"compliment_profile":0,"compliment_cute":0,"compliment_list":1,"compliment_note":8,"compliment_plain":4,"compliment_cool":6,"compliment_funny":6,"compliment_writer":5,"compliment_photos":1,"type":"user"}}
