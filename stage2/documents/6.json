If you are a FETA fan, please i beg you to try the <French Feta>. It is beyond creamy goodness.\nI have to say, you can also get your <Pecorino Romano> here as well as your <PARMIGIANO-REGGIANO> \nOh did I mention the full <Italian Deli>?? <Prosciutto>, <mortadella>, imported provolone and pancetta..i can go on and on( i use their homemade <Italian sausage> in my sauce)\nFraboni's is a TRUE Italian Specialty Store. \nI have not indulged in their ready foods, but based on the store itself, i wouldn't be surprised by excellence.\nPlease go in...be amazed by Italy in Madison.
