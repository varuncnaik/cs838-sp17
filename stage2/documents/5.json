I've been to lots of the Mexican Restaurants in Madison and El Rio Grande, although it may not have lots of Mexican trappings like serape's , burros and paintings of old old missions on the walls,had, the food was excellnet!  Best I've had in the Madison area. I never had a <soft taco> like this one - the soft shell was thick and soft and WONDERFUL and the tamale was edible, didn't burn my tongue off so much I couldn't eat it and VERY tasty. Also the <Spanish rice> did not come from a box or if it did, it was not like any boxed rice I ever tasted.  Also really liked their <chips> and salsa.  I would definitely go back and recommend it to friends. Friendly wait staff also.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review","restaurant":{"name":"El Rio Grande","neighborhood":"","address":"524 W Main St","city":"Stoughton","state":"WI","postal_code":"53589","latitude":42.9172006,"longitude":-89.2269704,"stars":4.5,"review_count":55,"is_open":1,"attributes":["Alcohol: full_bar","Ambience: {'romantic': False, 'intimate': False, 'classy': False, 'hipster': False, 'divey': False, 'touristy': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'casual': True}","BikeParking: False","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards: True","BusinessParking: {'garage': False, 'street': False, 'validated': False, 'lot': True, 'valet': False}","Caters: True","GoodForKids: True","GoodForMeal: {'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': True, 'dinner': True, 'breakfast': False, 'brunch': False}","HasTV: True","NoiseLevel: average","OutdoorSeating: False","RestaurantsAttire: casual","RestaurantsDelivery: True","RestaurantsGoodForGroups: True","RestaurantsPriceRange2: 2","RestaurantsReservations: True","RestaurantsTableService: True","RestaurantsTakeOut: True","WheelchairAccessible: True","WiFi: no"],"categories":["Restaurants","Mexican"],"hours":["Tuesday 11:0-21:0","Wednesday 11:0-21:0","Thursday 11:0-21:0","Friday 11:0-22:0","Saturday 11:0-22:0","Sunday 11:0-20:0"],"type":"business"},"user":{"name":"Patricia","review_count":16,"yelping_since":"2012-11-07","friends":["SIKt7Vcvi7Qo6a2GTkd5Qg","yMiikE7cpVyVLDnJRClLfg","3XsZzE8vOxmqx74m-G9YQg","D8qQCfSTV7ZDaBJ1-cJN3g","Tg0qc-nUsSjmq3LntB0U9Q","itzBQsyANrQQnCk74OT_lQ","fs1J8JgRqQusW9Pt-IXfnQ","NRMlDBUoGJdgoXTUllZpuA","LnfaHShZp_1vHJ6cqBMpQw","d7TcCByo8OJaTh9VVfnDgw","k81sEXH-Ymx7KlufQ0jOtw","CxtSL4-Wkp2ahMS9FWnxyg","zxu_WhuGaaUb0MarxNWBvQ","aLEpGDdZr_buxzSmb7ViHg","MGunJ0B3KhtZWOn7tnMveQ","Dljo_bQ3qOOvp_uqx7viTw","w4bIRTRtdSQ6FHE6aokJlg"],"useful":3,"funny":0,"cool":1,"fans":4,"elite":["None"],"average_stars":3.86,"compliment_hot":2,"compliment_more":0,"compliment_profile":1,"compliment_cute":0,"compliment_list":0,"compliment_note":0,"compliment_plain":1,"compliment_cool":0,"compliment_funny":0,"compliment_writer":0,"compliment_photos":0,"type":"user"}}
