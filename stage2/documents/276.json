Probably not going to happen.  Prices are a bit steep and  the service is S L O W.  We had <hummus> to start and the flavors were there but the <bread> was cold and stale.  It clearly came from a store and not made in house.  He brought out more after we left a bunch of <hummus> and no <bread>.  <Bread> the second go around was warm.  \n\nFood was just ok....veggies over cooked and chicken a bit dry.  There was one other table in the place so it wasn't like the kitchen was slammed.   \n\nThere are lots of dinning choices in Madison, I'm sorry this one won't be on my go to list.","useful":3,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review","restaurant":{"name":"Marrakesh","neighborhood":"Spring Harbor","address":"5510 University Ave","city":"Madison","state":"WI","postal_code":"53705","latitude":43.0830876,"longitude":-89.4754962,"stars":3.0,"review_count":32,"is_open":0,"attributes":["Alcohol: full_bar","Ambience: {'romantic': True, 'intimate': False, 'classy': False, 'hipster': False, 'divey': False, 'touristy': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'casual': False}","BikeParking: True","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards: True","BusinessParking: {'garage': False, 'street': False, 'validated': False, 'lot': True, 'valet': False}","Caters: True","DogsAllowed: False","GoodForKids: False","GoodForMeal: {'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': False, 'dinner': True, 'breakfast': False, 'brunch': False}","HasTV: False","NoiseLevel: quiet","OutdoorSeating: False","RestaurantsAttire: casual","RestaurantsDelivery: True","RestaurantsGoodForGroups: True","RestaurantsPriceRange2: 2","RestaurantsReservations: True","RestaurantsTableService: True","RestaurantsTakeOut: True","WheelchairAccessible: True","WiFi: free"],"categories":["Moroccan","Restaurants"],"hours":["Tuesday 17:0-21:0","Wednesday 17:0-21:0","Thursday 17:0-21:0","Friday 17:0-22:0","Saturday 17:0-22:0","Sunday 17:0-21:0"],"type":"business"},"user":{"name":"Ben","review_count":54,"yelping_since":"2011-05-01","friends":["23nRdGEw-A7riQpousC8Ug","f7Emr9Q4H5r_jO_DW3QuIQ","lenUwfiK5OpcOyCFiT1JYQ","pgqoh3R5RqP18Er-Ieo17g","e3eponP3ikkV4NlSuZZ2xg","tbycp0aRhRsiAVYUAVR_uQ","HNycc5PctOiR2PXb-TFCIQ","mA1cqTRnSqS779uFbTM8fg","ariUZ8i2dscHl6Qxa5mv9A","JUT0U3HTSB3kz9Wh7N0GqA","yOdvRvmLHt3rAVtzZ6jhoA","p_l23IOpTgCyHMJPTTmIlg","CH9VC7aLLsV8NFdaoU_uog"],"useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"fans":1,"elite":["2014","2013"],"average_stars":3.64,"compliment_hot":5,"compliment_more":1,"compliment_profile":0,"compliment_cute":0,"compliment_list":0,"compliment_note":5,"compliment_plain":2,"compliment_cool":4,"compliment_funny":4,"compliment_writer":5,"compliment_photos":2,"type":"user"}}
