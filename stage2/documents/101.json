Bonefish was very chic, yet understated in its' d\u00e9cor, and the interior design(s) perfectly augmented the dynamism of the place. My <pineapple martini> was smooth, delicious and did not overwhelm my palate for the delicacies to come. There was an exciting synchronicity among the waitstafff, servers and management personnel that added to the totality of our experience, They did a bang, bang job on the crispy and delicious <Bang Bag Shrimp>, while the <lobster tails> were bursting with robust freshness. We spent less than $30 roundtrip for a Badger Cab taxi from the heart of the UW campus to the west side location. Doesn't get any better than this.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review","restaurant":{"name":"Bonefish Grill","neighborhood":"","address":"7345 Mineral Point Rd","city":"Madison","state":"WI","postal_code":"53717","latitude":43.0601717613,"longitude":-89.5085259603,"stars":3.0,"review_count":116,"is_open":1,"attributes":["Alcohol: full_bar","Ambience: {'romantic': False, 'intimate': False, 'classy': False, 'hipster': False, 'divey': False, 'touristy': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'casual': True}","BikeParking: True","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards: True","BusinessParking: {'garage': False, 'street': False, 'validated': False, 'lot': True, 'valet': False}","Caters: False","GoodForKids: True","GoodForMeal: {'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': True, 'dinner': True, 'breakfast': False, 'brunch': False}","HasTV: True","NoiseLevel: average","OutdoorSeating: True","RestaurantsAttire: casual","RestaurantsDelivery: False","RestaurantsGoodForGroups: True","RestaurantsPriceRange2: 2","RestaurantsReservations: True","RestaurantsTableService: True","RestaurantsTakeOut: True","WheelchairAccessible: True","WiFi: no"],"categories":["Restaurants","Seafood"],"hours":["Monday 11:0-22:30","Tuesday 11:0-22:30","Wednesday 11:0-22:30","Thursday 11:0-22:30","Friday 11:0-23:30","Saturday 11:0-23:30","Sunday 10:0-21:0"],"type":"business"},"user":{"name":"Wilkins","review_count":44,"yelping_since":"2014-05-31","friends":["GRoP763J_dBBsaiwlN9OyQ","17ZiZ9ZUI0fsXYqBf7HQpA","bfAoM2YVg6MPKDHnqWuyzg","SozrtWKh-nrx5LKsq5XHZw","K2OD6Z3JPji_ElIT5FGOmA","tEOhgIMrojCn6hjdEXvubw","vy-DcE2Zbj9ljNCLY-hN_A","ZPgC4mGtePmGx2_PhSp0BQ","teFlTILoyeW5IcFDZIKL_g","mQWUWu6hXc_qoSe3RkH_Qg","J9MlZ-wojkvCuhc1XEzrEw","a5u2JBwKaP3KpH5VFpBG1A","avIatWbm1_4U-8wUC2DBJg","ZNsvdS7MT9KtxjjibHmzQg","I7wghIIOfR9Zy9cAeWK5qA","CW1Q2zP7NJMyrLL1JT_C9Q","CSrl_LtmWueTMQrn0JilKw","-FNlPcI4ahHWAHDKoq9s7w","FGXUFXEAwFbDIIfyoAIiPg","VrZsqxO8-bWrkhX4xj6ZiQ","iJRh0Q1vnUFWGx0LZrO9KQ","QFggD9AV6tD3-hq6LdLkYw","eApC6NxTnupJhpmDX0Ef9A","NwbXDKaLprDy3-4Rd8cVoA","ffVJabZQ2ap9DCj5o1gZtg","7w34BYIuug0vN2MeRF147w","zWPqe8bvU042aVYy7iymNg","-EQw17TM3Q2hLGJyPC_y-g","FkzHMwdJS5C99U7x87cwXg","DEeOPTvPnlv0R-GR5VmzPg","5-JnCirvb970UQCOJd_-5Q","J0oRFcOQZmkhH6epobZzvA","_z7VFgGA7hJQ_KUaq0ERzA","qD3g5mSXOcKXNFxqv4ggaQ","Vg6DZgt4KYhsX3pnRBQP1g","y766S3VpKKIBt0e0tg-miQ","Ijb0RlTZF1A5neLrap-hOA","mGJ5L1A5qyJhjjSeAvuHXQ","iq3eRRwhLUggIj0YXU9QsA","p4uim4eboVm9YC-g3ttqyA","C_M1_wcgKS5yQGeUXNN2WQ","rkosU0nPNAxpix5m4xjbEg","l9BvuKygyg7o-Ef7BcPxKA","4Me9MXha1y_2amRNtUaJpw"],"useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"fans":0,"elite":["None"],"average_stars":4.5,"compliment_hot":0,"compliment_more":0,"compliment_profile":0,"compliment_cute":0,"compliment_list":0,"compliment_note":0,"compliment_plain":1,"compliment_cool":0,"compliment_funny":0,"compliment_writer":1,"compliment_photos":0,"type":"user"}}
