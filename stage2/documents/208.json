Started kicking around ideas and ended up at Bunky's and we were not disappointed.\nFelt we were a bit early on a Saturday night, but the place was busy.  The upstairs was hosting a wedding reception, so that may have been why it seemed busy.  However, without a reservation we were immediately seated.  We didn't like the location of the today, and so we were graciously and immediately placed at a wonderful table by a window overlooking Atwood Ave.  Their best table, we were told.  Wow, lucky us!\nServer was immediately there and gave us the specials and a few minutes to look over the drink menu.  I went dark and enjoyed a <Lake Louie Porter>, she waited to decide what to have with dinner, and chose a lovely <chardonnay>.\nWe decided to start with the <falafel> appetizer.  We could have eaten multiple orders.  The <falafels> were perfect, crispy outside and just perfect inside.  The tahini sauce and warm pita complemented them well.\n \nFor main course, I went with the <Penne Gorgonzola>.  I had a <Gorgonzola burger> last week, so not sure if this is a trend.  The dish was great.  The tangy flavor of the plentiful gorgonzola alongside the fresh tomatoes, made for a delicious entr\u00e9e.  I'd order this again.  I was surprised I didn't get a side of bread.  I npticed other dinners had bread, so not sure if extra or an over sight on my entr\u00e9e.\nShe went with the <Chicken Marka>, which was a fine entr\u00e9e, but next time would probably choose something else, which would probably be the <falafel plate> given how much we enjoyed the appetizer.\n\nOrdered the <carrot cake> for dessert to go.  Perfect for breakfast the next day!!!\nWe'll be back.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":1,"type":"review","restaurant":{"name":"Bunky's Cafe","neighborhood":"Schenk - Atwood","address":"2425 Atwood Ave","city":"Madison","state":"WI","postal_code":"53704","latitude":43.0936656,"longitude":-89.3461227,"stars":4.0,"review_count":124,"is_open":0,"attributes":["Alcohol: beer_and_wine","Ambience: {'romantic': False, 'intimate': False, 'classy': False, 'hipster': False, 'divey': False, 'touristy': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'casual': True}","BikeParking: True","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards: True","BusinessParking: {'garage': False, 'street': True, 'validated': False, 'lot': True, 'valet': False}","Caters: True","GoodForKids: True","GoodForMeal: {'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': False, 'dinner': True, 'breakfast': False, 'brunch': False}","HasTV: False","NoiseLevel: average","OutdoorSeating: False","RestaurantsAttire: casual","RestaurantsDelivery: False","RestaurantsGoodForGroups: True","RestaurantsPriceRange2: 2","RestaurantsReservations: True","RestaurantsTableService: True","RestaurantsTakeOut: True","WheelchairAccessible: True","WiFi: no"],"categories":["Italian","Mediterranean","Restaurants","Moroccan"],"hours":["Wednesday 17:0-21:0","Thursday 17:0-21:0","Friday 11:0-14:0","Friday 17:0-22:0","Saturday 11:0-22:0","Sunday 17:0-21:0"],"type":"business"},"user":{"name":"Charlie","review_count":24,"yelping_since":"2013-04-07","friends":["PzSMct5t6gt92iN92VQMdg","tz-XOpnPZ0PIk0F8g5JM1A"],"useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"fans":1,"elite":["None"],"average_stars":4.17,"compliment_hot":0,"compliment_more":0,"compliment_profile":0,"compliment_cute":0,"compliment_list":0,"compliment_note":2,"compliment_plain":1,"compliment_cool":0,"compliment_funny":0,"compliment_writer":0,"compliment_photos":0,"type":"user"}}
