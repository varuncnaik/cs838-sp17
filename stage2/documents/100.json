We had a <beer> at the bar first - nice selection, although they were out of the <Pilsner>.  You have many local <beers> to choose from.  You can also get a <Bud> and <Bud Light> if you feel the need.  It was a gorgeous June night so we opted for a seat outside on the deck.  We ordered the <baked Walleye> and <fried Perch>.  The choice of potato were <fries>, <sweet potato fries> or a <green salad>.  I tried to make the meal a little healthier so I chose the <green salad>.  It came with a light vinaigrette dressing. It was quite good.  I also stole some <sweet potato fries> from my guest.  Next time choose the <sweet potato fries>.  The <Cole slaw> came topped with blue cheese - different but a nice change.  The <perch> was the best I have had in a long time.  My wife's <Walleye> was also very good.  The view from the deck was nice, we stayed for a long time talking and enjoying our <beers>. This place is worth the trip.  The price is a little more than most bars but worth it.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":1,"type":"review","restaurant":{"name":"Tap Room At Hawks Landing","neighborhood":"Hawk's Landing","address":"88 Hawks Landing Cir","city":"Madison","state":"WI","postal_code":"53593","latitude":43.034036434,"longitude":-89.5441021312,"stars":4.0,"review_count":14,"is_open":0,"attributes":["Alcohol: full_bar","Ambience: {'romantic': False, 'intimate': False, 'classy': False, 'hipster': False, 'divey': False, 'touristy': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'casual': False}","BikeParking: True","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards: True","BusinessParking: {'garage': False, 'street': False, 'validated': False, 'lot': False, 'valet': False}","CoatCheck: False","GoodForDancing: False","GoodForKids: True","HappyHour: True","HasTV: True","Music: {'dj': False, 'background_music': False, 'no_music': False, 'karaoke': False, 'live': False, 'video': False, 'jukebox': False}","NoiseLevel: quiet","OutdoorSeating: True","RestaurantsAttire: casual","RestaurantsDelivery: False","RestaurantsGoodForGroups: True","RestaurantsPriceRange2: 2","RestaurantsReservations: True","RestaurantsTableService: True","RestaurantsTakeOut: True","Smoking: no"],"categories":["Pubs","Restaurants","American (New)","Bars","Nightlife"],"hours":["Monday 11:0-2:0","Tuesday 11:0-2:0","Wednesday 11:0-2:0","Thursday 11:0-2:0","Friday 11:0-2:0","Saturday 10:0-2:0","Sunday 10:0-2:0"],"type":"business"},"user":{"name":"Tom","review_count":15,"yelping_since":"2014-05-01","friends":["None"],"useful":0,"funny":1,"cool":0,"fans":0,"elite":["None"],"average_stars":3.6,"compliment_hot":0,"compliment_more":0,"compliment_profile":0,"compliment_cute":0,"compliment_list":0,"compliment_note":0,"compliment_plain":0,"compliment_cool":1,"compliment_funny":1,"compliment_writer":1,"compliment_photos":0,"type":"user"}}
