Husband got <tea>, <breakfast sandwich> number 1 and a <strawberry lemon pop tart>. I got <citrus iced black tea>, <breakfast sandwich> number 2 and a <blueberry raspberry scone>. The <scone> and the \"<pop tart>\" we're good. This place is definitely a good bakery. <Tea> was ok. Nothing to write home about (but keep in mind we are <tea> snobs - to someone who just likes <tea> sometimes it might be great <tea>). \nThe <sandwiches> were the really underwhelming part. We did not have to wait at all to order. Just walked in and went to the counter and ordered, place was full, but not stuffed. But it still took over 20 minutes to get 2 <sandwiches>. We could deal with that if the <sandwiches> were amazing, but they just weren't. Very greasy, with flat biscuits that crumbled apart (not in a good way). \nOverall, I would recommend them for their bakery items, but unless you like eating super greasy biscuits, try something else on the menu.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":1,"type":"review","restaurant":{"name":"4&20 Bakery & Cafe","neighborhood":"Emerson East","address":"305 N 4th St","city":"Madison","state":"WI","postal_code":"53704","latitude":43.0982338,"longitude":-89.3570463,"stars":4.5,"review_count":127,"is_open":1,"attributes":["Alcohol: none","Ambience: {'romantic': False, 'intimate': False, 'classy': False, 'hipster': False, 'divey': False, 'touristy': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'casual': True}","BikeParking: True","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards: True","BusinessParking: {'garage': False, 'street': True, 'validated': False, 'lot': False, 'valet': False}","Caters: True","GoodForKids: True","GoodForMeal: {'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': False, 'dinner': False, 'breakfast': True, 'brunch': True}","HasTV: False","NoiseLevel: average","OutdoorSeating: False","RestaurantsAttire: casual","RestaurantsDelivery: False","RestaurantsGoodForGroups: False","RestaurantsPriceRange2: 1","RestaurantsReservations: False","RestaurantsTableService: False","RestaurantsTakeOut: True","WheelchairAccessible: True","WiFi: free"],"categories":["Coffee & Tea","Food","Bakeries","Breakfast & Brunch","Restaurants"],"hours":["Tuesday 7:0-14:30","Wednesday 7:0-14:30","Thursday 7:0-14:30","Friday 7:0-14:30","Saturday 7:0-14:30","Sunday 8:30-14:30"],"type":"business"},"user":{"name":"Melissa","review_count":37,"yelping_since":"2013-10-01","friends":["TZvjjbe4-6-V2-jcEFWffg","wBbjgHsrKr7BsPBrQwJf2w","EjUnRsznKU-AhDlMaXe5iA","t2YHHr_V2lNLEZYGTJTF2g","9uTKsjOjIxK1nc9ds1732A","m3LR3cFk3emshWYVh7hqhg"],"useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"fans":3,"elite":["None"],"average_stars":4.54,"compliment_hot":0,"compliment_more":0,"compliment_profile":0,"compliment_cute":0,"compliment_list":0,"compliment_note":0,"compliment_plain":0,"compliment_cool":0,"compliment_funny":0,"compliment_writer":0,"compliment_photos":0,"type":"user"}}
