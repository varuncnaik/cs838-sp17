I liked everything from the ambiance to the yummy smells drifting from the kitchen. I just moved back to Madison after living near San Francisco, CA. I didn't think the Thai/Vietnamese places there could be beat...\nI was wrong!\nHa Long Bay was outstanding. I went for a birthday dinner with my family & everything was perfect. Our meals were both delicious & brought out in a timely manner. That's always a good sign with a bigger party (6 adults, 1 baby). Our server was awesome! Always had our drinks full & very friendly. I believe her name was Sandy. I'll be requesting her every time I go (I'll for sure be back soon)! When she noticed it was my Bday, she even brought me out a complementary <blueberry wonton dessert>. It was soooo good! :) Now that is good customer service! \nThis is one of my new Madison favorites! 5 stars :)","useful":3,"funny":0,"cool":1,"type":"review","restaurant":{"name":"Ha Long Bay Vietnamese & Thai Bistro","neighborhood":"Williamson - Marquette","address":"1353 Williamson St","city":"Madison","state":"WI","postal_code":"53703","latitude":43.0855448,"longitude":-89.3607155,"stars":4.0,"review_count":468,"is_open":1,"attributes":["Alcohol: beer_and_wine","Ambience: {'romantic': False, 'intimate': False, 'classy': False, 'hipster': False, 'divey': False, 'touristy': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'casual': True}","BikeParking: True","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards: True","BusinessParking: {'garage': False, 'street': True, 'validated': False, 'lot': False, 'valet': False}","Caters: False","GoodForKids: True","GoodForMeal: {'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': True, 'dinner': True, 'breakfast': False, 'brunch': False}","HasTV: False","NoiseLevel: average","OutdoorSeating: False","RestaurantsAttire: casual","RestaurantsDelivery: False","RestaurantsGoodForGroups: True","RestaurantsPriceRange2: 2","RestaurantsReservations: True","RestaurantsTableService: True","RestaurantsTakeOut: True","WheelchairAccessible: True","WiFi: no"],"categories":["Restaurants","Vietnamese","Thai"],"hours":["Monday 11:0-21:30","Tuesday 11:0-21:30","Wednesday 11:0-21:30","Thursday 11:0-21:30","Friday 11:0-21:30","Saturday 11:0-21:30","Sunday 11:30-21:0"],"type":"business"},"user":{"name":"Sarah","review_count":5,"yelping_since":"2012-07-30","friends":["owigWp_E5_vXXR7eaT2Pxg","a_M_HwpwQk0Q5r3-kJrCCA","x79fzxpnRu5ds_oEsOP5Yw","aZYTFInU6eI2nb6a4IdftQ"],"useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":0,"fans":0,"elite":["None"],"average_stars":4.0,"compliment_hot":2,"compliment_more":1,"compliment_profile":0,"compliment_cute":0,"compliment_list":0,"compliment_note":0,"compliment_plain":0,"compliment_cool":1,"compliment_funny":1,"compliment_writer":0,"compliment_photos":0,"type":"user"}}
