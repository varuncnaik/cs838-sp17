And I highly enjoyed it. I once dragged a friend with me down Park St all the way 2 blocks from the capital in January, took the bus to the restaurant and then decided to walk back in the foot-deep snow (bad decision). I digress. \nTheir <lunch buffet> is quite good, the delivery a bit pricier.\nBut, once again, it blew away most things offered by the other three, and no need to feel like you'll die afterwards.\n\nStill... if this is the best in Madison... another reason I'm glad I moved out.","useful":0,"funny":1,"cool":0,"type":"review","restaurant":{"name":"Jade Garden","neighborhood":"Bay Creek","address":"1109 S Park St","city":"Madison","state":"WI","postal_code":"53715","latitude":43.0548686,"longitude":-89.3968494,"stars":3.0,"review_count":46,"is_open":1,"attributes":["Alcohol: none","Ambience: {'romantic': False, 'intimate': False, 'classy': False, 'hipster': False, 'divey': False, 'touristy': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'casual': True}","BikeParking: True","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards: True","BusinessParking: {'garage': False, 'street': True, 'validated': False, 'lot': True, 'valet': False}","Caters: True","GoodForKids: True","HasTV: False","NoiseLevel: quiet","OutdoorSeating: False","RestaurantsAttire: casual","RestaurantsDelivery: True","RestaurantsGoodForGroups: True","RestaurantsPriceRange2: 1","RestaurantsReservations: False","RestaurantsTableService: False","RestaurantsTakeOut: True","WheelchairAccessible: True","WiFi: no","GoodForMeal: {'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': True, 'dinner': True, 'breakfast': False, 'brunch': False}"],"categories":["Restaurants","Chinese","Buffets"],"hours":["Monday 11:0-22:0","Tuesday 11:0-22:0","Wednesday 11:0-22:0","Thursday 11:0-22:0","Friday 11:0-22:30","Saturday 11:0-22:30","Sunday 11:30-22:0"],"type":"business"},"user":{"name":"Matthew","review_count":63,"yelping_since":"2009-09-04","friends":["2qdQN4en6EG41O3zDLPryA","NAveOLf6TNxea7A0ZxRnTA","O1gxGw5uGcgkOeFI2a2Stg","ciYOsNx4tHGE9KSC7us3vg","IJi70DHqzpNo_5EEuSP1MA","sz_QmSPe8JGsoDLjrTwQBQ","dWW2NIpnN28w_EzM3Ebctg","AlGz5BLX7yNJZhDyISLUSg","qAgMzdcGhF-lNFfIw6qrCw","VcfhETBTVB-CUows6yMsnA","3gm8JDG1bWARFyT07mmoog","Ig5vsgRVDNUozPLc6HjIxA","6AKefJkxjEulK4TkmrLyEw","z9CO6GN9Gra6tyc9ldpbLA","zbWfKkLLRcnM1tYQYCvIbg","zBBVL_jpop9AKjoeC0keVA","MGPQVLsODMm9ZtYQW-g_OA","mH7cwm1wC7OHU31ZSCJ_Dg","5O5B045xIaSMt71TzIAtdw"],"useful":13,"funny":5,"cool":1,"fans":0,"elite":["None"],"average_stars":2.92,"compliment_hot":0,"compliment_more":0,"compliment_profile":0,"compliment_cute":0,"compliment_list":0,"compliment_note":2,"compliment_plain":0,"compliment_cool":2,"compliment_funny":2,"compliment_writer":0,"compliment_photos":0,"type":"user"}}
