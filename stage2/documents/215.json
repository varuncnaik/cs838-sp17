We went in during evening hours and it was bustling with people. A relaxing covered patio with a view of the Capitol building and plenty of seating/lounging room on the inside. My husband tried the <Fyxation> recommended by an employee and he enjoyed it. I tried the <Espresso Shake> and it was amazing. I believe it was blended with espresso beans and brewed espresso.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":1,"type":"review","restaurant":{"name":"Colectivo Coffee","neighborhood":"Capitol","address":"25 S Pinckney St","city":"Madison","state":"WI","postal_code":"53703","latitude":43.0747431,"longitude":-89.3821255,"stars":4.0,"review_count":122,"is_open":1,"attributes":["BikeParking: True","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards: True","BusinessParking: {'garage': False, 'street': True, 'validated': False, 'lot': False, 'valet': False}","OutdoorSeating: True","RestaurantsPriceRange2: 1","RestaurantsTakeOut: True","WiFi: free"],"categories":["Food","Restaurants","Coffee & Tea","Cafes"],"hours":["Monday 6:0-21:0","Tuesday 6:0-21:0","Wednesday 6:0-21:0","Thursday 6:0-21:0","Friday 6:0-21:0","Saturday 6:0-21:0","Sunday 7:0-20:0"],"type":"business"},"user":{"name":"Amanda","review_count":24,"yelping_since":"2014-12-20","friends":["Q-2XEzgkVnPLsWaCIHfs0Q","Ko01Bph_vOdLw0BGvn_Sew","O7SSTbec5hr-O-x-6ub8Ww","pRr7-BxtytZ5cnv5lzFcGQ","WC8DCjtVieC6nYEE0ZZmsQ","zcKAElTRKkIQBjflGr1XAw","VThrJ_LXfwyKMTjTBhjt2w","7BK7kFhMyS-kpDAdvjbDzw","gcda8RpK8vtZuARpNh3LyQ","pDZeShWN_hx3sf-KBSt0Qg","aYwrZhd9TLaUKaQD4ovq4w"],"useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":1,"fans":0,"elite":["None"],"average_stars":3.92,"compliment_hot":0,"compliment_more":0,"compliment_profile":0,"compliment_cute":0,"compliment_list":0,"compliment_note":0,"compliment_plain":0,"compliment_cool":0,"compliment_funny":0,"compliment_writer":0,"compliment_photos":0,"type":"user"}}
