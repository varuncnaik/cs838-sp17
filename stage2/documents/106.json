Ive come here a few times for brunch and tried a lot of their offerings, but the only thing that really has any wow factor to me are those <cheese curds>.\n\n*update*\n\nI just finished eating non brunch here for the first time. Im not a big <burger> fan, so i cant say much about it, but the <mac and cheese> was a masterpiece. Medium, al dente shells in a rich, thick, garlicky cheese sauce. It tastes like some seriously aged cheese!\n\n*another update*\n\nI just became the duke and realized that ive eaten here a lot of times (forgot to check in for some of those times). If i'm eating here so much, i must seriously love it, so im bumping this up to 5.\n\nThis time around, i just came back from a heavy day at the gym and was craving something with some meat, big flavor, and lots of fresh vegetables for my post workout meal. The <bibimbap> really delivered! I think it couldve used more rice to be more similar to what my korean grandma makes, but it was perfect for my veggie craving because it was packed with fresh cucumber, radish, and carrots. This was the perfect follow up to my protein shake.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review","restaurant":{"name":"Graze","neighborhood":"Capitol","address":"1 S Pinckney
