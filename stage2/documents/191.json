Literally everything about my experience was wrong when I was visiting Madison some weeks back.  I had heard from my close friend who lives there that it was this amazing creperie that made one heck of a <cup of Joe>, and all I got out of it was delayed, soggy, hipster pretentiousness. \n\nFirst and foremost, for the \"popularity\" of this little restaurant, it is tiny.  When we arrived, it was quite crowded inside, and shortly after there was a line out the door.  There's practically no place to put up your coat in the cold weather, and if you want to try and eat there - good luck!  Seating is definitely not ample and the crowd all trying to sit down and talk at once makes for a bit of an angry mob.\n\nAs for the food - my friend and I ordered two <crepes> - one savory with gouda, apple, buckwheat, and ham, and the other with apples and pecans.  Both were simply \"eh\" to say the least.  Part of the savory <crepe> was crisp the way it should be, and another portion was soggy and mushy.  The inside was struggling for flavor beyond the overpowering whole grain mustard (which I do enjoy), but the gouda flavor was basically undetectable and I was also searching for sliced apples.  The most annoying part to me perhaps was that the filling had thinly sliced ham instead of chunks which led to even more sadness about the whole experience.  In order to really get the flavor of meat in a <crepe>, you've got to do better than deli sliced blandness.\n\nHonestly worst of all, the service was unorganized and a confused mess.  After entering and placing our order right away, it took roughly 25 minutes to get our <crepes> to us because our order was forgotten.  Other people who came in after received their orders before us which made me raise my voice to ask what was going on.  What was going on, you ask?  They had crossed off our ticket despite never even making our meal.\n\nWhat an utterly disappointing disaster.  I hope to forget you soon, Bradbury's.","useful":1,"funny":1,"cool":0,"type":"review","restaurant":{"name":"Bradbury's","neighborhood":"Capitol","address":"127 N Hamilton
