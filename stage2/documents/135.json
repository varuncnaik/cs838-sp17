Starting with the friendly and efficient service, each aspect of the dinner was memorable.  Shared a starter of <Anabasque cheese with garnishes> then a unique and delicious <beet salad>.  Our entrees were the <salmon special> and a chicken dish.  Both were so unusual--very hard to describe and so good!.  Only had room for a dish of <maple ice cream> for dessert.  I've dined there many times and it never disappoints.  Highly recommended for your fine dining choice but it's also possible to go and have a couple of yummy \"smalls\" if you are not up for the entire gala evening.   Chef/owner Dan Fox is the most unassuming and personable chef I've ever met.  Kudos to Dan and his people!","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review","restaurant":{"name":"Heritage Tavern","neighborhood":"Capitol","address":"131 E Mifflin St","city":"Madison","state":"WI","postal_code":"53703","latitude":43.0768340202,"longitude":-89.3832337316,"stars":4.5,"review_count":250,"is_open":1,"attributes":["Alcohol: full_bar","Ambience: {'romantic': False, 'intimate': False, 'classy': True, 'hipster': False, 'divey': False, 'touristy': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'casual': False}","BikeParking: True","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards: True","BusinessParking: {'garage': False, 'street': True, 'validated': False, 'lot': False, 'valet': False}","Caters: True","GoodForKids: False","GoodForMeal: {'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': False, 'dinner': True, 'breakfast': False, 'brunch': False}","HasTV: False","NoiseLevel: average","OutdoorSeating: True","RestaurantsAttire: casual","RestaurantsDelivery: False","RestaurantsGoodForGroups: True","RestaurantsPriceRange2: 3","RestaurantsReservations: True","RestaurantsTableService: True","RestaurantsTakeOut: False","WiFi: free"],"categories":["American (New)","Restaurants","Gastropubs"],"hours":["Monday 16:0-0:0","Tuesday 16:0-0:0","Wednesday 16:0-0:0","Thursday 16:0-0:0","Friday 16:0-1:0","Saturday 17:0-1:0","Sunday 9:30-14:0"],"type":"business"},"user":{"name":"Mary","review_count":3,"yelping_since":"2014-05-14","friends":["None"],"useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"fans":0,"elite":["None"],"average_stars":3.75,"compliment_hot":0,"compliment_more":0,"compliment_profile":0,"compliment_cute":0,"compliment_list":0,"compliment_note":0,"compliment_plain":0,"compliment_cool":0,"compliment_funny":0,"compliment_writer":0,"compliment_photos":0,"type":"user"}}
