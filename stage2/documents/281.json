As other reviews state, the menu was large and seemed to have a lot of good choices. We started out with the <Deep Fried Pickles> and the <Cheese Curds>. Although both tasted pretty good, the amount of <cheese curds> received, is definitely not worth $8!\n\nFor my main course, I choose the <Margherita pizza> with pesto. The flavors were all great and I could tell the ingredients were all very fresh. There was one big problem though, the dough was still very doughy! \nThe others in our party seemed to enjoy the food for the most part, nothing really to rave about.\n\nOverall, just ok..won't be going out of my way to go there again.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review","restaurant":{"name":"1855 Saloon and Grill","neighborhood":"","address":"218 S.
