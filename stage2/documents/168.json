Probably for the rest of the week, for that matter. No toughness at all to the ham and melty cheese on a fresh-baked croissant with a fig tapenade that's the real showstopper. You probably haven't yearned for fig on a hot ham and cheese, but it's damn tasty.\n\nBe ready for a communal dining experience. The tables are close together, and it seemed like a lot of people knew each other. We would up sharing a table with a couple that came in behind us just because the place is so tiny. I enjoyed that aspect, but I can see how it'd be a drawback for some.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":1,"type":"review","restaurant":{"name":"Sophia's Bakery & Cafe","neighborhood":"Tenney - Lapham","address":"831 E Johnson St, Ste 4","city":"Madison","state":"WI","postal_code":"53703","latitude":43.0838052,"longitude":-89.3768109,"stars":4.5,"review_count":180,"is_open":1,"attributes":["Alcohol: none","Ambience: {'romantic': False, 'intimate': False, 'classy': False, 'hipster': True, 'divey': False, 'touristy': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'casual': False}","BYOB: False","BYOBCorkage: no","BikeParking: True","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards: False","BusinessParking: {'garage': False, 'street': True, 'validated': False, 'lot': False, 'valet': False}","Caters: False","GoodForKids: True","GoodForMeal: {'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': False, 'dinner': False, 'breakfast': True, 'brunch': True}","HasTV: False","NoiseLevel: average","OutdoorSeating: True","RestaurantsAttire: casual","RestaurantsDelivery: False","RestaurantsGoodForGroups: False","RestaurantsPriceRange2: 1","RestaurantsReservations: False","RestaurantsTableService: False","RestaurantsTakeOut: True","WheelchairAccessible: True","WiFi: no"],"categories":["Food","Restaurants","Breakfast & Brunch","Bakeries"],"hours":["Saturday 8:0-14:0","Sunday 8:0-14:0"],"type":"business"},"user":{"name":"Nick","review_count":8,"yelping_since":"2010-08-09","friends":["_LthIwm_nXTVo-oLhHIvEQ","HF3BrbLVJ_RJKOLWIZ5FTg","a_uJLd1Y2qpIL8DfTLtZyg","aRLuIK9vXrH721udlcE82w","UZ-f2pW7n4dHO2prGYYaqw","8_o8_0DWczEMVpZfdxpR7A","vVVgP8dPdkmlUYj20Pp6YA","Nb6hG8PIIqUW69bTKQw6Fw","CceVCOVyyzDBqJ6NSDa1mA","31beRP3hWcAUNAQsJEgxXQ","k4HuBm2BEZWOwAc0dYGGAg","H91PS79Q1hnIM_gDDCTsHw","LL1ZKN9DMzQQlL9VyQ3NZQ","gTgrcUOVt7wgOnDQx7--pA","rYrkyRO-IdWGKMGLPdO03A","YPcX-QQIoGqruqUGlpSB1w","xjBV6BNrzmuyH9kNMbwiyA","z9lNxCs9Dy24J8A0xWN1tA","xuobLSKoM7HRhNmWohYhBA","JM0jzh87LqCdVv9X4Dp-bQ","myDe1DGIeTp0B5gVQ7RTqw","rUESL58ZoOwra3TqIpBQ3A","Dh_QSCnK_T6zLtzqISh39g","SVFcyko4MvC2z29AgmFzaA","xvcBp44tz71sgfjOAybRkw","OVwvyDr6dYhW8glKjKut-g","IlWOZN60_3cIxdLZ1Wq7Bg","T5y_Vxx_6S4WtJJnzbA1kQ"],"useful":4,"funny":0,"cool":0,"fans":1,"elite":["None"],"average_stars":4.25,"compliment_hot":0,"compliment_more":0,"compliment_profile":0,"compliment_cute":0,"compliment_list":0,"compliment_note":0,"compliment_plain":0,"compliment_cool":0,"compliment_funny":0,"compliment_writer":0,"compliment_photos":0,"type":"user"}}
