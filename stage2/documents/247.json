We waited an hour which is expected at 6pm on a Saturday. My take on this place it i s a throwback to a generation of let's fry everything. Very noisy very hectic atmosphere. Which is great if your out with the boys but not a dinner with the wife. \nI ordered a medium <ribeye> and <fries>. The wife really wanted a <burger> so she had one also. My <steak> was cooked perfectly and so was her <burger>. We both spoke about it and split our meals and decided that the meat seasoning is very heavy handed. Also a very very intense grilled flavor that makes it so you can't taste the beef. Otherwise overall the food was good. The atmosphere was not my cup of tea. So I will try it again someday.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review","restaurant":{"name":"The Old Fashioned","neighborhood":"Capitol","address":"23 N Pinckney St","city":"Madison","state":"WI","postal_code":"53703","latitude":43.0761862475,"longitude":-89.3837572172,"stars":4.0,"review_count":1236,"is_open":1,"attributes":["Alcohol: full_bar","Ambience: {'romantic': False, 'intimate': False, 'classy': False, 'hipster': False, 'divey': False, 'touristy': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'casual': True}","BikeParking: True","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards: True","BusinessParking: {'garage': False, 'street': True, 'validated': False, 'lot': False, 'valet': False}","Caters: False","GoodForKids: True","GoodForMeal: {'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': True, 'dinner': True, 'breakfast': False, 'brunch': False}","HasTV: True","NoiseLevel: loud","OutdoorSeating: True","RestaurantsAttire: casual","RestaurantsCounterService: True","RestaurantsDelivery: False","RestaurantsGoodForGroups: True","RestaurantsPriceRange2: 2","RestaurantsReservations: False","RestaurantsTableService: True","RestaurantsTakeOut: True","WheelchairAccessible: False","WiFi: free"],"categories":["American (Traditional)","Restaurants","German","American (New)","Steakhouses","Bars","Breakfast & Brunch","Salad","Nightlife"],"hours":["Monday 7:30-22:30","Tuesday 7:30-0:0","Wednesday 7:30-1:0","Thursday 7:30-1:0","Friday 7:30-1:30","Saturday 9:0-1:30","Sunday 9:0-22:30"],"type":"business"},"user":{"name":"Matt","review_count":21,"yelping_since":"2010-04-17","friends":["VulwIcdAKHpSmBRiFlNcrw","ihyM9m8YbsEnco2VrYM85Q","Y0H04ZxhkDtrtPiz5BygeQ","WoumWFPjr-TS6e5sI8mrHA","xriNBlQ3bNGw5amTMB-z5Q","pURgCn_eLzyBjtm0C9Mfuw","kQyXqenwvNliDgpPswvegg","J0gZMeOlVvndAacjigdsmw","zuTebg3eUdjtPUdayNIgog","zS3Yd0umREonAfOQPhPkPg","WXh-ZI2MsquDEkVhPeHBYg","7Lx7tRusZw5cgHy9QBukSA","LJGjOv47j9yHYxqIqI-ozA","UHh87lSloCxD3yTu-B-DkQ","SZZziU_fko1NUkZGamUIow","LZr21P-5otgSt8yuBaEsVQ","xOu8L4D4FTk8we21gV0jFQ","4UFiaTDHp6d0guzbTg9gSA","J7oDld_wA-iJV3MBogDepg","mQtRzwmeQYrjSeB3094POg","whwDsikNN3c_QilcDZkkxA","VlJYSX68DU6Q60lbE6oH1g","ghyiLtxWu9czRW-oG-nk6w","_6vUafA-0hAwt3-p4ECtwA","tLHn39KYjb76Ro0AgqC_pg","RtTGpQMjuCR15CCDN3qhMw","mep0XOvHNM2jNIeFfSRJSg","Up0pbc94XtHWKiFxIVzYWA","V-BItnIcvSKowxfVXUNtxg","QqCJTlqqGBMlTm_fa7kgpw","vVfYl1rqESabJU-Z3wjWEg","f5xfwi9mregMt6KOv3mJtA","mz9T-8zQz7TyeeCFUKo7nw","8TXmXhIG7aTfL3lpALrjvw","X6JsONem5Z3gFWiyYQJH3A","O75AElDTd05L5EFDQ7-pkw","dq8VTlqwaH05xkPJnQPYDA","-gAsViq8fQ-VpLapKpSuUA","eMB3hme2XwjML-cGrFoVag","YMZgtBDnqVmTrka4COzUaA","maa8H4bEvN1kBFTS4ts7kw","kt1lmW6LcrXAkZsRE1aaTg","14yXi1LbUWmOdSaUVYm5bQ","3j7DSLlZZtMuhDjsN0fYOQ","mGGMuGLJu71JEfZHrhsatg","XjklOW0aqk0LtnfDDkpbyQ","O-uT06CCkWYYMXUkK-4zPg","lWvpFa3YI2G-D3_6Lvp6zQ"],"useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"fans":0,"elite":["None"],"average_stars":4.19,"compliment_hot":0,"compliment_more":0,"compliment_profile":0,"compliment_cute":0,"compliment_list":0,"compliment_note":0,"compliment_plain":0,"compliment_cool":0,"compliment_funny":0,"compliment_writer":1,"compliment_photos":0,"type":"user"}}
