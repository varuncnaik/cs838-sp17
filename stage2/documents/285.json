{"review_id":"ApDd2bsDE-iRCBhEzeSakQ","user_id":"8967jLjZDBacMRNnc8b7XA","business_id":"-pV9kWNoA9vyHfM_auYecA","stars":1,"date":"2014-02-10","text":"I don't normally leave reviews, but I feel as though I'm performing a community service by urging others to avoid this place.\n\nThe <beer> selection:  It certainly seems robust, except for the fact that what you want is nearly guaranteed to have \"just run out.\"  Nowhere else in town do I find it necessary to pick 3 <beers> when I sit down just to ensure they will actually have what I want stocked.\n\nThe food... yikes.  Well it's not cheap, for one thing.  <Sandwiches> run about 10 dollars each and come with only a small amount of (what looks like your standard grocery store bagged) spring mix greens or chips.  <Frites> are an option, for an extra $2 (!!!).  The standard dipping sauce for the fries is a malt vinegar aioli, which had the exact aftertaste of spoiled milk and received universally negative reviews from my dining companions.  Let's get to the main events:\n\nMy first entree was the <pork belly mac>.  \nPlating:  Messy, no appealing colors or garnish.  Pork belly was splash of dark on the light colored mac.  Boring.\n\nThe pork belly:  An incredibly small amount for $14, and ALL fat--no thin strip of delicious bacony meat as you'd normally expect.  It was also burned (properly cooked it's crisp, not charcoal) on both sides but lukewarm and gelatinous on the inside.  \n\nThe mac:  Sauce was awful.  The dubliner cheddar in the sauce made for a grainy texture with very little flavor.  In fact at many times the dominant taste was flour... someone evidently needs to work on their roux.  You can't be making such a sub par cheese sauce in the CAPITAL OF WISCONSIN.  C'mon.\n\nMy next visit, I got the <chicken sandwich>.\nThe chicken:  Rubbery on the inside, tough on the outside but with no sear whatsoever on this \"pan-seared\" chicken.  I'm not even sure how to achieve this texture... steaming? Microwaved?\n\nThe bread:  Toasted sourdough.  Half inch thick slices of hard, toasted bread saturated with butter or some kind of oil.  The thickness of the bread made it very difficult to eat.  Diagonal slices, please.  The roof of my mouth thanks you in advance.\n\nThe accoutrements:  While technically there, the bacon, avocado, butter lettuce and cheddar toppings were not present in sufficient quantity to contribute anything to the taste of the sandwich, really unfortunate; it was this combination of toppings that actually drew me to the sandwich.  The chipotle mayo added a nice hint of smokiness, and was the only positive part of the experience.\n\nDESPITE the truly mediocre food, the service has been fantastic here every time I've gone.  The servers seem genuinely apologetic about the food and very knowledgeable about the beers they DO have that might be SIMILAR to what I actually wanted.\n\nSuffice to say, I likely won't go back here again.  Maybe, just maaaybe for a <beer> if I'm joining friends, but when it comes to food you can do MUCH better literally anywhere else.","useful":3,"funny":1,"cool":1,"type":"review","restaurant":{"name":"The Cooper's Tavern","neighborhood":"Capitol","address":"20 W Mifflin St","city":"Madison","state":"WI","postal_code":"53703","latitude":43.075216,"longitude":-89.386276,"stars":3.5,"review_count":320,"is_open":1,"attributes":["Alcohol: full_bar","Ambience: {'romantic': False, 'intimate': False, 'classy': False, 'hipster': False, 'divey': False, 'touristy': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'casual': True}","BestNights: {'monday': False, 'tuesday': False, 'friday': True, 'wednesday': True, 'thursday': False, 'sunday': False, 'saturday': True}","BikeParking: True","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards: True","BusinessParking: {'garage': False, 'street': True, 'validated': False, 'lot': False, 'valet': False}","Caters: False","CoatCheck: False","GoodForDancing: False","GoodForKids: False","GoodForMeal: {'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': True, 'dinner': True, 'breakfast': False, 'brunch': False}","HappyHour: True","HasTV: True","Music: {'dj': False, 'background_music': False, 'no_music': False, 'karaoke': False, 'live': False, 'video': False, 'jukebox': False}","NoiseLevel: average","OutdoorSeating: True","RestaurantsAttire: casual","RestaurantsDelivery: False","RestaurantsGoodForGroups: True","RestaurantsPriceRange2: 2","RestaurantsReservations: False","RestaurantsTableService: True","RestaurantsTakeOut: True","Smoking: no","WheelchairAccessible: True","WiFi: free"],"categories":["American (New)","Nightlife","Pubs","Restaurants","Bars"],"hours":["Monday 11:0-2:0","Tuesday 11:0-2:0","Wednesday 11:0-2:0","Thursday 11:0-2:0","Friday 11:0-2:0","Saturday 9:0-2:0","Sunday 9:0-2:0"],"type":"business"},"user":{"name":"Jeff","review_count":7,"yelping_since":"2014-02-10","friends":["lwt38fvAHdzlNerCC2eiFA","9fKP48k4aozFC8xUpho-8g","7kCdsqzbfQV0b3KxS34QYw","wd3xoNaDLib8dhQ7BxUl6g","Otot7I3GOJJvrWM2cyuCfQ","wurJLbqM_iM0R64dQ8r3Qw","HEttNqW4IyMLR0rCNlbW2A","5t_1uY62hQatxAZ86--exg","It2h1t3pfSAYH_tqrXbIJg","XrggI004sNOuLaG265XG7w","v7sJcYJFp5RKn1B4DexQrQ","ei6vElX7V77HJzgeTKZiKA","BrxyHYLiTNu8BNhEleBLpQ","c-313hiyiZnxTxH9v3AXXA","q0dpnji0fJyYUlzraFMUTg","9uyzXsVt7NfszGUjRrrfug","v0iJ5CvpeC26mVYL7GbhcQ","y9yttpGtJ1GO4d1_aEDUQw","Obl3f26hjOFpX05Mhht9Ew","tqyWBTe_QSlpVP6rB9hr5Q","fJ_qSZH_akvWzHUPMqab1g","6U8W7VNRpOzNmtqYpJ-_1A","GirIxv2C0Clf2enG460aEA","glMFlcRKd70Oo0cRA0fsTw"],"useful":2,"funny":1,"cool":0,"fans":1,"elite":["None"],"average_stars":4.0,"compliment_hot":2,"compliment_more":0,"compliment_profile":0,"compliment_cute":0,"compliment_list":0,"compliment_note":2,"compliment_plain":0,"compliment_cool":1,"compliment_funny":1,"compliment_writer":0,"compliment_photos":0,"type":"user"}}
