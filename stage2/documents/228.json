It was mid week around 6:00pm, the wait was about 20 minutes with no reservations.\nWe ended up going into the bar to wait and grab a <beer>.  I was impressed with the types/varieties of their <craft beers>.  I had a <IPA type beer> and just was not thrilled with it.  I wish I had gotten something a little less hoppy or asked for a sample before.  Normally I like <IPA's> but this one missed the mark for me.\n\nFor dinner, we all ordered a bunch of appetizers to share, the food is OK but nothing special as it is just greasy bar food to me.  \nFor our main meals we each got different options: <fish>, <burgers>, <salads>, etc.  Again everything was OK but it wasn't great quality or flavor.  \n\nThe service was excellent and this is a great place to bring a large group. I think this restaurant is a fan favorite due to the cheap prices of the food and the <beer> variety.  Next time I would just come here for a drink and go somewhere else to eat.  There are so many great places for food around Madison.  I can see why this bar is a big hit with the students as after all of our food/drinks we each only spent about $30 including tip.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review","restaurant":{"name":"The Great Dane","neighborhood":"Capitol","address":"123 E Doty St","city":"Madison","state":"WI","postal_code":"53703","latitude":43.0744454814,"longitude":-89.3800637126,"stars":4.0,"review_count":604,"is_open":1,"attributes":["Alcohol: full_bar","Ambience: {'romantic': False, 'intimate': False, 'classy': False, 'hipster': False, 'divey': False, 'touristy': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'casual': True}","BYOB: False","BYOBCorkage: no","BestNights: {'monday': False, 'tuesday': False, 'friday': True, 'wednesday': False, 'thursday': True, 'sunday': False, 'saturday': True}","BikeParking: True","BusinessAcceptsBitcoin: False","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards: True","BusinessParking: {'garage': True, 'street': True, 'validated': False, 'lot': False, 'valet': False}","Caters: False","CoatCheck: False","Corkage: False","DogsAllowed: False","GoodForDancing: False","GoodForKids: True","HappyHour: True","HasTV: True","Music: {'dj': False, 'background_music': False, 'no_music': False, 'karaoke': False, 'live': False, 'video': False, 'jukebox': False}","NoiseLevel: average","OutdoorSeating: True","RestaurantsAttire: casual","RestaurantsCounterService: True","RestaurantsDelivery: False","RestaurantsGoodForGroups: True","RestaurantsPriceRange2: 2","RestaurantsReservations: True","RestaurantsTableService: True","RestaurantsTakeOut: True","Smoking: no","WheelchairAccessible: True","WiFi: free","GoodForMeal: {'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': True, 'dinner': True, 'breakfast': False, 'brunch': False}"],"categories":["Food","Restaurants","American (Traditional)","American (New)","Bars","Breweries","Pubs","Nightlife"],"hours":["Monday 11:0-2:0","Tuesday 11:0-2:0","Wednesday 11:0-2:0","Thursday 11:0-2:0","Friday 11:0-2:30","Saturday 11:0-2:30","Sunday 10:0-2:0"],"type":"business"},"user":{"name":"Lindsey","review_count":172,"yelping_since":"2009-06-19","friends":["rif0tXWC9EzJyw4z2dAfog","ZpCVwrv47H2nD3ktleI4bA","WcS_I42tAYvJD0xTHhaeUw","zqbH9ePDd2RQo2UEAtDo5w","Xtvww0Syf9hFHgPNz1_Sww","vee4vOvO67F0ku93WQ0gtQ","M6xzMmBznU2e_aM3RWov_w","gPh8rpoOq2hjyhF2pAdn2A","pbu7KMyd7VgNhJ-7YRK_8Q","jhvreOViehq5zA4p2dgSVg","WDUUb4CRat6JQ9MaNKh9wA","1Frm6sLDsYRpsN-jB0dSKQ","fOatYPIIUivp-71g-IAE9A","e7E_ydV3DbSLvOokREZ3tw","qmXKvtJe83rMLXsvkRMlBQ","LbeHQ0frxP6sJew2fKZ8fw","azMvrknuhrltarYknkr4vg","GBgrrIKycTBAK_H-nQSfVw","2w6tmJ36mkvYTOUTTtFrgw","UUqGHQFu2tQDGv5r3yJWPA","S3l7V2pB_07K3K98Xf_SGQ","ZPDj0KynzjbdC8KHR7TmPw","yBf8uuNe4WjsifvaMHxUcg","bDfO8bg_NPjri37VpFkXPw","Jrhk28CwpBNX3yArqDHjvQ","D2setZ2_pKZ9CWEb0IgrOQ","vnuLgLc1rOJDN7ZfLvgEig","MVpdMTbHr5zjrRbkQ_XXEQ","C6LV0p8L6IfBfh1YFRkWzQ","XAgSDbxFyEgf6_UIZ_qmQw","N61hkQVfKF0GXP3UIVnbWw","2f0z22RLYES9HpR4gp6lhw","nl8gWLDo6U6MjqzbBmE_9A","oHiAmHNkea-uc_JHl14HMg","ZTcqKKKKoWcMCFaMyC5tIQ","FkHWUfNkeTdhqvyuXWLmRg","rcU7ysY41qGppbw4pQgjqg","T-RXw8NLmZ4IhzNQ5pM38g","Ct3hCphRxdpkGwpytGe36A","OJzXMUS00iHO4D98szkzBQ","K1NiUMCldSB1OFuIScJXaA","iT2l42z13BZWTTvqqtMvaA","r-jXqOreID2LgqUidOcJWw","z30o7gTmg0xyJh0NlX-x3Q","B99rJaOMtkH1txcQhUl24w","xc1opNkFCnAjsPXs7jqtfg","8cvp_IjFGoGPq5RU51KRAg","iOFgaa89sFk20zmi4YC6Ww","I1EyoGXNdGCMgEvDjg1hhw","t903_es-gp3abvdrIQutQA","MRqSuTMSKgPv_YchvVW-lQ","4Yh6AlVOdaToWsttGVkp1w","FuYA5bnSPJ7h0V9JT2GPOw","vLbzO4yY7c7_4enfadxFGQ","-fPyiQdVga8kPPLpypS9FQ","ypNMhijdI6AX7dkX2P5-Xg","pW9LvtC-hZ0PRAOUn7aZ2A","GGTF7hnQi6D5W77_qiKlqg","rihV8C3SLph37Sb4YVNJiA","Lkn3pCmnoo7mLQPUwVMSIw","nYPRCN6Ah223R_ar0il4nQ","fDfDU0itqoHc-HxS0jaEvg","_ufafAo3DfPSscGj32wShw","txdQD4xVXL8AKv1yO3guzw","t6LW6ZH9T2YwS-l35rl25w","QEz6osxBbJZNXPA36LVLEA","XRK7yUttVVJRKYXVzyIUzg","B_FU78XGYUL3zkPSUGC7aQ","l0j8sIcQ6MVsbtMfmNajLA","a10qLAGmgBy4cCAHNoULsg","5kMii2JySygayQpyPBjqCA","IrN8TKnbtflUz1MjJ3Mhmg","v5KnH3hiDYyu2cnAmwt-hg"],"useful":234,"funny":75,"cool":25,"fans":13,"elite":["2017","2016","2015"],"average_stars":4.29,"compliment_hot":7,"compliment_more":1,"compliment_profile":0,"compliment_cute":1,"compliment_list":1,"compliment_note":8,"compliment_plain":10,"compliment_cool":9,"compliment_funny":9,"compliment_writer":6,"compliment_photos":0,"type":"user"}}
