We ordered three sides, <sweet potato chips>, <fries>, and <fried cheese curds>, along with <burgers> and a <grilled cheese>.  All three sides were cold when they arrived at the table.  The <burgers> were out together but our order of a <grilled cheese> was considerable behind the rest of the food.  The <burgers> were decent but smaller than those I have had at Dottie's and Weary Traveler.\n\nThere was a table tent that said 'Show us today's parking receipt and save two bucks on tasty grub'.  We offered up our parking stub but our waitress said she would have to keep the sub to give the discount  (even though the table tent says 'show us' not 'give us').  Since we need it to get out of the parking garage, and we won't get an actual parking 'receipt' until we leave downtown.  This is kind of a ridiculous offer.  \n\nOverall, the peanut rails are fun, but not enough to outweigh the cold food, poor service, and discount gimmicks.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review","restaurant":{"name":"AJ Bombers","neighborhood":"Capitol","address":"201 W Gorham St","city":"Madison","state":"WI","postal_code":"53703","latitude":43.075138,"longitude":-89.39081,"stars":3.5,"review_count":85,"is_open":0,"attributes":["Alcohol: full_bar","Ambience: {'romantic': False, 'intimate': False, 'classy': False, 'hipster': False, 'divey': False, 'touristy': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'casual': True}","BikeParking: True","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards: True","BusinessParking: {'garage': False, 'street': True, 'validated': False, 'lot': False, 'valet': False}","Caters: False","DriveThru: False","GoodForKids: True","GoodForMeal: {'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': True, 'dinner': False, 'breakfast': False, 'brunch': False}","HasTV: True","NoiseLevel: average","OutdoorSeating: False","RestaurantsAttire: casual","RestaurantsDelivery: True","RestaurantsGoodForGroups: True","RestaurantsPriceRange2: 2","RestaurantsReservations: False","RestaurantsTableService: True","RestaurantsTakeOut: True","WheelchairAccessible: True","WiFi: free"],"categories":["Burgers","Event Planning & Services","Venues & Event Spaces","American (Traditional)","Restaurants"],"hours":["Monday 11:30-21:0","Tuesday 11:30-21:0","Wednesday 11:30-21:0","Thursday 11:30-21:0","Friday 11:30-22:0","Saturday 11:30-22:0","Sunday 11:30-21:0"],"type":"business"},"user":{"name":"Pamela","review_count":7,"yelping_since":"2009-07-31","friends":["None"],"useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"fans":0,"elite":["None"],"average_stars":2.86,"compliment_hot":0,"compliment_more":0,"compliment_profile":0,"compliment_cute":0,"compliment_list":0,"compliment_note":0,"compliment_plain":0,"compliment_cool":0,"compliment_funny":0,"compliment_writer":0,"compliment_photos":0,"type":"user"}}
