There were a few recent reviews posted regarding restaurant week which had me concerned. Staff was attentive even with a a full house. Food came out quick and accurate. The <mixed green salad> was on the sweet side between the dried berries, candied nuts and maple balsamic; no complaints but definitely not the healthiest salad. I also tried my wife's clam chowder and regret not ordering which says a lot because I very much dislike clam chowder. This soup was creamy and had the perfect amount of clam flavor without being too pungent. The <surf and turf> came out hot, too hot to touch and the food stayed hot until finished due to it being served on a hot plate. I had the surf and turf and this entree surpassed plenty of similar courses I have had at other establishments, just not much finesse with the plating. Dessert was the <cheesecake> and the tart door county cherries made the dish. Washrooms were clean; furniture could use a refresh and the Christmas decor needs to go. Great experience and will be back.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":1,"type":"review","restaurant":{"name":"Mariners Inn","neighborhood":"","address":"5339 Lighthouse Bay Dr","city":"Madison","state":"WI","postal_code":"53704","latitude":43.1488048,"longitude":-89.4069668,"stars":3.5,"review_count":46,"is_open":1,"attributes":["Alcohol: full_bar","Ambience: {'romantic': False, 'intimate': False, 'classy': False, 'hipster': False, 'divey': False, 'touristy': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'casual': True}","BikeParking: True","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards: True","BusinessParking: {'garage': False, 'street': False, 'validated': False, 'lot': True, 'valet': False}","Caters: True","GoodForKids: False","GoodForMeal: {'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': False, 'dinner': True, 'breakfast': False, 'brunch': False}","HasTV: True","NoiseLevel: average","OutdoorSeating: True","RestaurantsAttire: casual","RestaurantsDelivery: False","RestaurantsGoodForGroups: True","RestaurantsPriceRange2: 3","RestaurantsReservations: True","RestaurantsTableService: True","RestaurantsTakeOut: True","WheelchairAccessible: True","WiFi: free"],"categories":["Seafood","Restaurants","Steakhouses","American (Traditional)"],"hours":["Monday 17:0-21:0","Tuesday 17:0-21:0","Wednesday 17:0-21:0","Thursday 17:0-21:0","Friday 16:30-22:0","Saturday 16:30-22:0","Sunday 16:30-21:0"],"type":"business"},"user":{"name":"Nate","review_count":1,"yelping_since":"2010-12-15","friends":["None"],"useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"fans":0,"elite":["None"],"average_stars":5.0,"compliment_hot":0,"compliment_more":0,"compliment_profile":0,"compliment_cute":0,"compliment_list":0,"compliment_note":0,"compliment_plain":1,"compliment_cool":0,"compliment_funny":0,"compliment_writer":0,"compliment_photos":0,"type":"user"}}
