I was looking forward to it for a few days and I was not disappointed! I went with a friend. We ordered the <Soppressata> and the <Four Cheese with bacon>. (See photos I posted)\n\nFirst off, the <Four Cheese pizza> was amazing! I was hooked as soon as I took that first bite! Such a perfect combination of cheeses! The <bacon>, when I tried a few pieces that fell off the <pizza>, was very good and had a nice smoky flavor. Though, I don't think it added anything to the <four cheese pizza>; I couldn't taste it above the cheeses.  My friend and I agreed that this <pizza> would complement nicely with a <red wine>.\n\nThe <Soppressata> was very good as well. We both enjoyed it, but had a hard time returning to it after we tried the awesome <Four Cheese pizza!> \n\nI really enjoy the <wood-fired pizzas> and I will definitely return in the future!","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review","restaurant":{"name":"S2pizzabar","neighborhood":"Capitol","address":"558 State St","city":"Madison","state":"WI","postal_code":"53703","latitude":43.075141,"longitude":-89.394958,"stars":4.0,"review_count":15,"is_open":0,"attributes":["Alcohol: beer_and_wine","Ambience: {'romantic': False, 'intimate': False, 'classy': False, 'hipster': False, 'divey': False, 'touristy': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'casual': True}","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards: True","BusinessParking: {'garage': False, 'street': True, 'validated': False, 'lot': False, 'valet': False}","DogsAllowed: False","GoodForKids: True","GoodForMeal: {'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': True, 'dinner': True, 'breakfast': False, 'brunch': False}","HasTV: False","NoiseLevel: average","OutdoorSeating: False","RestaurantsAttire: casual","RestaurantsDelivery: False","RestaurantsGoodForGroups: True","RestaurantsPriceRange2: 1","RestaurantsReservations: False","RestaurantsTableService: False","RestaurantsTakeOut: True","WheelchairAccessible: True","WiFi: no"],"categories":["American (New)","Salad","Restaurants","Pizza"],"hours":["Tuesday 11:0-22:0","Wednesday 11:0-22:0","Thursday 11:0-22:0","Friday 11:0-22:0","Saturday 11:0-22:0","Sunday 11:0-22:0"],"type":"business"},"user":{"name":"A","review_count":19,"yelping_since":"2009-08-24","friends":["None"],"useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":1,"fans":0,"elite":["None"],"average_stars":2.95,"compliment_hot":0,"compliment_more":0,"compliment_profile":0,"compliment_cute":0,"compliment_list":0,"compliment_note":2,"compliment_plain":1,"compliment_cool":0,"compliment_funny":0,"compliment_writer":0,"compliment_photos":0,"type":"user"}}
