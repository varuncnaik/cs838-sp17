All are beautiful and look delicious, but not things I'd typically buy at a bakery. I may eat little fancy one-serving desserts at a restaurant, but I don't know why I'd bring them home. \n\nSoon, they will offer a little more when they start selling gelato. They gave me a free sample and it was pretty good! Complex flavors and super rich. Was nice to sit outside in the sun and enjoy.\n\nThe macarons are SOOO DELICIOUS! Almost made me not hate myself for paying $2.50 for a medium sized cookie. Almost.\n\nI realize it's a high end shop, but I just don't think I could justify paying these prices unless I was giving a gift or something.","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review","restaurant":{"name":"Madison Sourdough Patisserie","neighborhood":"Williamson - Marquette","address":"916 Williamson
