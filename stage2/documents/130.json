Tempest Oyster Bar is in the old Magus spot.  Three of us went on a weekday and the place was PACKED; we had reservations and were seated right away.  The service was attentive, but we were seated in the bar area and I thought it was loud.  The abbreviated menu was fine for us and we all ordered different appetizers, entrees and desserts so we had a bit of a tasting experience.  The <crab cakes> were OK, but my <smoked fish appetizer> was very good.  One had a <pasta and seafood medley> (the <pasta> was over done) but the <salmon> and <blue marlin> entrees were very good.  Hard to know if the desserts were made on premises since they were all just OK.  <Wine> list was good, overall experience good.  They can do a better job of fixing up the entry/vestibule; it was just STRANGE.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review","restaurant":{"name":"Tempest Oyster Bar","neighborhood":"Capitol","address":"120 E Wilson St","city":"Madison","state":"WI","postal_code":"53703","latitude":43.0739300186,"longitude":-89.3796241524,"stars":4.0,"review_count":167,"is_open":1,"attributes":["Alcohol: full_bar","Ambience: {'romantic': False, 'intimate': False, 'classy': True, 'hipster': False, 'divey': False, 'touristy': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'casual': False}","BestNights: {'monday': False, 'tuesday': False, 'friday': True, 'wednesday': False, 'thursday': True, 'sunday': False, 'saturday': True}","BikeParking: True","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards: True","BusinessParking: {'garage': False, 'street': True, 'validated': False, 'lot': False, 'valet': False}","Caters: False","CoatCheck: True","GoodForDancing: False","GoodForKids: False","GoodForMeal: {'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': False, 'dinner': True, 'breakfast': False, 'brunch': False}","HappyHour: True","HasTV: False","Music: {'dj': False, 'background_music': False, 'no_music': False, 'karaoke': False, 'live': False, 'video': False, 'jukebox': False}","NoiseLevel: average","OutdoorSeating: True","RestaurantsAttire: casual","RestaurantsDelivery: False","RestaurantsGoodForGroups: True","RestaurantsPriceRange2: 3","RestaurantsReservations: True","RestaurantsTableService: True","RestaurantsTakeOut: False","Smoking: no","WiFi: no"],"categories":["Nightlife","Seafood","Bars","Restaurants","Steakhouses"],"hours":["Monday 16:0-22:0","Tuesday 16:0-22:0","Wednesday 16:0-22:0","Thursday 16:0-22:0","Friday 16:0-0:0","Saturday 10:0-0:0","Sunday 10:0-22:0"],"type":"business"},"user":{"name":"Rob","review_count":83,"yelping_since":"2013-04-06","friends":["mv7dcK6odBsG-zoJpQLu8Q","A167QTZJFN2sABOhS0UkkA","GKNRoH-q0luNjgRhNQvYRA","GVuU1qYR_pWFEVezVjm8hQ","wd3xoNaDLib8dhQ7BxUl6g","cDhs0eRMGtVVXzr5eiGiIQ","XmUoErm8KkfP_ti71nXgAg","d5WLqmTMvmL7-RmUDVKqqQ","AzrW6hrOgj3b-F6Iu-JedA","JUT0U3HTSB3kz9Wh7N0GqA"],"useful":1,"funny":2,"cool":1,"fans":2,"elite":["2016","2017"],"average_stars":4.15,"compliment_hot":4,"compliment_more":0,"compliment_profile":0,"compliment_cute":0,"compliment_list":0,"compliment_note":2,"compliment_plain":4,"compliment_cool":6,"compliment_funny":6,"compliment_writer":4,"compliment_photos":2,"type":"user"}}
