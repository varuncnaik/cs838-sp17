We had a group of 20 people and the waitstaff was super accommodating. Was initially unsure of this spot as no one I know has eaten there...but, exceeded expectations. The food was great...I crushed an outstanding <burger> perfectly prepared...and, all in our party left happy / satisfied...I would absolutely recommend this spot to anyone, and likely go here again when I'm back in Madison.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review","restaurant":{"name":"The Madison Blind","neighborhood":"Capitol","address":"601 Langdon St","city":"Madison","state":"WI","postal_code":"53703","latitude":43.075643309,"longitude":-89.3954746098,"stars":4.0,"review_count":42,"is_open":1,"attributes":["Alcohol: full_bar","Ambience: {'romantic': False, 'intimate': False, 'classy': False, 'hipster': False, 'divey': False, 'touristy': False, 'trendy': True, 'upscale': False, 'casual': False}","BestNights: {'monday': False, 'tuesday': False, 'friday': True, 'wednesday': False, 'thursday': False, 'sunday': False, 'saturday': False}","BikeParking: True","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards: True","BusinessParking: {'garage': False, 'street': False, 'validated': False, 'lot': True, 'valet': True}","Caters: False","CoatCheck: False","DogsAllowed: False","GoodForDancing: False","GoodForKids: False","GoodForMeal: {'dessert': False, 'latenight': True, 'lunch': False, 'dinner': True, 'breakfast': False, 'brunch': False}","HappyHour: True","HasTV: True","Music: {'dj': False, 'background_music': False, 'no_music': False, 'karaoke': False, 'live': False, 'video': False, 'jukebox': False}","NoiseLevel: average","OutdoorSeating: True","RestaurantsAttire: casual","RestaurantsDelivery: False","RestaurantsGoodForGroups: True","RestaurantsPriceRange2: 2","RestaurantsReservations: False","RestaurantsTableService: True","RestaurantsTakeOut: False","Smoking: no","WheelchairAccessible: True","WiFi: free"],"categories":["Restaurants","Cocktail Bars","American (New)","Diners","Bars","Nightlife"],"hours":["Monday 16:30-0:0","Tuesday 16:30-0:0","Wednesday 16:30-0:0","Thursday 16:30-0:0","Friday 15:0-2:0","Saturday 15:0-2:0","Sunday 16:30-0:0"],"type":"business"},"user":{"name":"Jim","review_count":15,"yelping_since":"2014-04-11","friends":["None"],"useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0,"fans":0,"elite":["None"],"average_stars":3.33,"compliment_hot":0,"compliment_more":0,"compliment_profile":0,"compliment_cute":0,"compliment_list":0,"compliment_note":0,"compliment_plain":0,"compliment_cool":0,"compliment_funny":0,"compliment_writer":0,"compliment_photos":0,"type":"user"}}
