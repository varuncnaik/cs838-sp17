We always got <coffee> there in the mornings, whoever was up first would hop over and get some <coffee>.  Usually it was her.  The <coffee> was ok, looking back it wasn't worth a trip to the place next door.\n\nThe food?  Don't get me started.  It's the most inadequate food I've ever had to pay for.  The <bread> was stale, the meats were boring, the vegetables were weak.  Because it was next door, we'd eat their from time to time.  And it honestly wasn't that great.\n\nDon't go out of your way to eat here, but if you happen to live next door, it's an ok stop for <coffee>.\n\nAlthough, I must admit: it was nice to kick back in the outdoor dining area and relax with a <coffee>.","useful":1,"funny":1,"cool":0,"type":"review","restaurant":{"name":"Electric Earth Cafe","neighborhood":"Capitol","address":"546 W Washington Ave","city":"Madison","state":"WI","postal_code":"53703","latitude":43.0690688,"longitude":-89.3921799,"stars":3.5,"review_count":31,"is_open":0,"attributes":["Alcohol: none","Ambience: {'romantic': False, 'intimate': False, 'classy': False, 'hipster': False, 'divey': False, 'touristy': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'casual': False}","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards: True","BusinessParking: {'garage': False, 'street': True, 'validated': False, 'lot': False, 'valet': False}","Caters: False","DriveThru: False","GoodForKids: True","GoodForMeal: {'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': False, 'dinner': False, 'breakfast': True, 'brunch': False}","HasTV: False","NoiseLevel: quiet","OutdoorSeating: True","RestaurantsAttire: casual","RestaurantsDelivery: False","RestaurantsGoodForGroups: True","RestaurantsPriceRange2: 1","RestaurantsReservations: False","RestaurantsTableService: False","RestaurantsTakeOut: True","WheelchairAccessible: True","WiFi: free"],"categories":["Fast Food","Food","Coffee & Tea","Restaurants"],"hours":["Monday 7:0-23:0","Tuesday 7:0-23:0","Wednesday 7:0-23:0","Thursday 7:0-23:0","Friday 7:0-18:0","Saturday 8:0-18:0","Sunday 8:0-18:0"],"type":"business"},"user":{"name":"Thom","review_count":125,"yelping_since":"2009-06-25","friends":["tG5s3vgVpHun0unatapjMg","3aik_Y37oG71BP-ilfdVxQ","laIIOkd1GwhnmMbr_P7ULA","BkKVGpLRCuPYEHNBzHKR6w","7zhra0LL0dLYo4Nmo5Q_xA","EDnUI0TOmyO2gKJFPIBhfQ","DI_UG-rvI0XQkv8fDfBcMQ","Ocz_Adp2JGTakaUq2m04fg","EXYKJAELRnZ1-MB1Uqapcw","2EHraAFHDwyFtrXrzsKFMg","en1QeoaMU8C79p2pqOdP_w","MGPQVLsODMm9ZtYQW-g_OA","8wX2zsYZb1SdqqTR7iJbDg","h6AqYcz0S1HfZM4UeVSing"],"useful":19,"funny":24,"cool":14,"fans":1,"elite":["2010"],"average_stars":3.75,"compliment_hot":2,"compliment_more":0,"compliment_profile":0,"compliment_cute":0,"compliment_list":0,"compliment_note":0,"compliment_plain":3,"compliment_cool":2,"compliment_funny":2,"compliment_writer":2,"compliment_photos":1,"type":"user"}}
