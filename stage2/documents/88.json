You order at the counter and grab a table. They have a sweet and a savory breakfast menu, with a number of unique and fun drink options, including a 25 ingredient Bloody Mary. \n\nI loved the sweet potato pancakes with mascarpone and fresh strawberries. The cheesy <BBQ pulled pork grits> were also amazing!  They also have traditional eggs, bacon, potatoes and sourdough toast, which are good portions.\n\nThe restaurant is open for brunch and late night, for breakfast anytime.
