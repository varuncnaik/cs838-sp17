{"review_id":"NXNHcYLqkE16NjwfyWwxUQ","user_id":"jfDJu2-w5a8eGV5XRvoKqw","business_id":"V1JEkeAem05hps5ZCmMIgw","stars":5,"date":"2013-08-05","text":"This was the first restaurant/pub I visited when I moved to Madison last October, and it quickly became a favorite. Most of the food is great - I'd highly recommend the burgers (I like the <Here Comes> the <Sun burger> with the <fried egg> on top), the <turkey club wrap> and ANY of the soups.  The chefs are talented and creative;  try one of their daily specials some time.  The <mac and cheese> is a favorite.  They also have fabulous fresh-baked goods (best <strawberry scones> I've ever had.)\n\nOK, I started with the food, but the real draw here is the atmosphere, which is a great blend of two elements; the tasteful Beatles decor and the friendly staff. My particular favorite is the giant retro album mosaic, including both classics (eponymous Led Zeppelin) and rarities (yeah, my mind just drew a blank). Don't expect All Beatles All The Time;  I doubt anyone can survive that narrow niche - but the music is fun and eclectic.\n\nThere is a large upstairs which frequently hosts talent;  some of my favorites over the last year have been The Dirty Pigeons, Colorphase, Misery Jackals and Under the Willow. \n\nTuesday night trivia is a must;  Kim is a character;  a latter-day Betty Boop with attitude. \n\nTap beers are limited, but they are switched up frequently, so there's always something new to try. Someone said the <Gummy Bears> were no joke - I would have to second that. \n\nI should mention I'm 50.  The weekend late-night crowd makes me feel like a relic, but any other time there is a wide variety of ages in both regulars (like me) and newcomers.  But whoever you are, I guarantee you will feel welcome.","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":1,"type":"review","restaurant":{"name":"The Rigby Pub And Grill","neighborhood":"Capitol","address":"119 E Main St","city":"Madison","state":"WI","postal_code":"53703","latitude":43.0749931,"longitude":-89.3811037,"stars":3.5,"review_count":45,"is_open":1,"attributes":["Alcohol: full_bar","Ambience: {'romantic': False, 'intimate': False, 'classy': False, 'hipster': False, 'divey': False, 'touristy': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'casual': True}","BestNights: {'monday': False, 'tuesday': False, 'friday': True, 'wednesday': False, 'thursday': True, 'sunday': False, 'saturday': True}","BikeParking: True","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards: True","BusinessParking: {'garage': True, 'street': True, 'validated': False, 'lot': False, 'valet': False}","Caters: True","CoatCheck: False","DogsAllowed: False","GoodForDancing: False","GoodForKids: False","GoodForMeal: {'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': True, 'dinner': False, 'breakfast': False, 'brunch': False}","HappyHour: True","HasTV: True","Music: {'dj': False, 'background_music': False, 'no_music': False, 'karaoke': False, 'live': False, 'video': False, 'jukebox': False}","NoiseLevel: average","OutdoorSeating: True","RestaurantsAttire: casual","RestaurantsDelivery: False","RestaurantsGoodForGroups: True","RestaurantsPriceRange2: 2","RestaurantsReservations: True","RestaurantsTableService: True","RestaurantsTakeOut: True","Smoking: outdoor","WheelchairAccessible: True","WiFi: free"],"categories":["Nightlife","Event Planning & Services","Restaurants","Music Venues","Arts & Entertainment","Caterers","Venues & Event Spaces","Bars","Party & Event Planning","Pubs","Italian","American (New)"],"hours":["Monday 11:0-2:0","Tuesday 11:0-2:0","Wednesday 11:0-2:0","Thursday 11:0-2:0","Friday 11:0-2:30","Saturday 11:0-2:30","Sunday 12:0-2:0"],"type":"business"},"user":{"name":"Julie","review_count":24,"yelping_since":"2011-02-11","friends":["uzeixno7jpcN3qLmHPHy1Q","BAcxurGUnRFPC_EcvCGRAw","SdKMjARj2HJQvqt9NvtTJQ","caICV2psm7OABEkikMx2vw","RQM9b6p7INXvBetIvOrYbg","5aH-A9ituCjiWqf_L3-6Kw","KOKG5pw5LasPuc7d2GzyMw","9ii2s29b8mM20j5r2m-8sA","BMVikD5l5nUZasNEi9Zg0g","yur46ZvWT-TdFdUwA6r0FA","evz6wGwcPVNLuimJpnHSjg","8AJHbhygIH3jMRQH8JAfWQ","QddbtMyiRLgA6-7T_TnhBw","2MVb1NWLzyJmbMuxcZDfQw"],"useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0,"fans":0,"elite":["None"],"average_stars":3.84,"compliment_hot":0,"compliment_more":0,"compliment_profile":0,"compliment_cute":1,"compliment_list":0,"compliment_note":0,"compliment_plain":0,"compliment_cool":1,"compliment_funny":1,"compliment_writer":0,"compliment_photos":0,"type":"user"}}
