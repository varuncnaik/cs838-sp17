My partner and I eat South East Asian religiously. When we travel we look for Southeast Asian restaurants mainly Thai,  Lao, Vietnamese. There are several very good <curry> use in Madison we just happen to be blessed with good <curries>. But the <curries> here at Sala Thai are unmatched. Richly flavored, fragrant,..... so tasty!! The <Pad Krapao> is a spicey masterpiece!  The <spicey noodles>, <LAAB>, <Pad Wun Sen>.....good. If you like spice and heat, come here. But every dish can be made to your specific heat tolerance including zero heat. And the soups? <Won Ton>, <PHO>, <Tom Yum>.....again, simply the best in town!! This is a family business and they are typically a bit short waitstaff. So if you want to great food come here. But please understand in advance you may have to wait a bit for it. Don't come here if you are on a short schedule.  I also must say that they have the friendliest waitstaff in owners in the business!! I LOVE this place!!!","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":1,"type":"review","restaurant":{"name":"Sala Thai Restaurant","neighborhood":"Starkweather - Yahar","address":"36 S Fair Oaks Ave","city":"Madison","state":"WI","postal_code":"53714","latitude":43.0987829,"longitude":-89.3338313,"stars":3.5,"review_count":75,"is_open":1,"attributes":["Alcohol: beer_and_wine","Ambience: {'romantic': False, 'intimate': False, 'classy': False, 'hipster': False, 'divey': False, 'touristy': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'casual': True}","BikeParking: True","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards: False","BusinessParking: {'garage': False, 'street': True, 'validated': False, 'lot': False, 'valet': False}","Caters: False","GoodForKids: True","GoodForMeal: {'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': False, 'dinner': True, 'breakfast': False, 'brunch': False}","HasTV: False","NoiseLevel: average","OutdoorSeating: False","RestaurantsAttire: casual","RestaurantsDelivery: False","RestaurantsGoodForGroups: True","RestaurantsPriceRange2: 2","RestaurantsReservations: False","RestaurantsTableService: True","RestaurantsTakeOut: True","WheelchairAccessible: True","WiFi: no"],"categories":["Restaurants","Thai"],"hours":["Tuesday 17:0-21:0","Wednesday 11:0-14:30","Wednesday 17:0-21:0","Thursday 11:0-14:30","Thursday 17:0-21:0","Friday 11:0-14:30","Friday 17:0-21:0","Saturday 11:0-14:30","Saturday 17:0-21:0","Sunday 17:0-21:0"],"type":"business"},"user":{"name":"Michael","review_count":8,"yelping_since":"2012-05-13","friends":["Ccxy8fyysQhjN_AlM8zBng","LYsvFpkHOXn7kqGYPfeLCQ","P3hI4KZJhiALgGJyPxqBqA","DNvXBeaJV3U1U1ab3Gpodw","hJrMCkPm6JOkb4Jf5h4rYA","m2hvbZeSChqHY_aAbswX4w"],"useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0,"fans":0,"elite":["None"],"average_stars":3.33,"compliment_hot":0,"compliment_more":0,"compliment_profile":0,"compliment_cute":0,"compliment_list":0,"compliment_note":1,"compliment_plain":0,"compliment_cool":0,"compliment_funny":0,"compliment_writer":0,"compliment_photos":0,"type":"user"}}
