Guess because it never seemed busy. \nIntimate place, great for couples or double date. \nVery good seafood at reasonable price for a higher end restaurant. \nGood <wine> list. \nG\nTry the most excellent <creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e> - one of the best in Madison as they add a little liquor to the sugar before carmelizing the top and it is outstanding. \nAlso, sides are very good and reasonably priced. \nService last Friday was excellent. We went in late, and they made us feel very welcome and not rushed at all, which is more than one can say for some of our other high end restaurants in town.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review","restaurant":{"name":"The Blue Marlin","neighborhood":"Capitol","address":"101 N Hamilton St","city":"Madison","state":"WI","postal_code":"53703","latitude":43.0768864,"longitude":-89.3838974,"stars":4.0,"review_count":46,"is_open":0,"attributes":["Alcohol: full_bar","Ambience: {'romantic': False, 'intimate': True, 'classy': False, 'hipster': False, 'divey': False, 'touristy': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'casual': False}","BYOB: False","BYOBCorkage: no","BikeParking: True","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards: True","BusinessParking: {'garage': False, 'street': True, 'validated': False, 'lot': False, 'valet': False}","Caters: False","GoodForKids: False","GoodForMeal: {'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': False, 'dinner': True, 'breakfast': False, 'brunch': False}","HasTV: False","NoiseLevel: average","OutdoorSeating: True","RestaurantsAttire: dressy","RestaurantsDelivery: False","RestaurantsGoodForGroups: False","RestaurantsPriceRange2: 3","RestaurantsReservations: True","RestaurantsTableService: True","RestaurantsTakeOut: False","WiFi: no"],"categories":["Seafood","Restaurants"],"hours":["Monday 17:0-21:0","Tuesday 17:0-22:0","Wednesday 17:0-22:0","Thursday 17:0-22:0","Friday 11:30-14:30","Friday 17:0-22:0","Saturday 17:0-22:0","Sunday 17:0-21:0"],"type":"business"},"user":{"name":"John","review_count":110,"yelping_since":"2011-03-07","friends":["oc2HbLtmHm8CG7I7kBxvRw","l2svqej0FSC-Qyx7x0iLTA","jY9NrVPUaJh3HzX4iCOUGQ","o_6fMZKX_vZDsSmnEPMjcA","d5WLqmTMvmL7-RmUDVKqqQ","lkFH9unKY4qA4xT_8qlFzw","8ZLAklUl3vS9cnlwpv3v5g","fsrnuOinLOvoFhqUxQy4cA","2GYyqD8wsv4MOcqoy0Rs0Q","e9bVxMuG-1NIJWqT_pDEmQ","wd3xoNaDLib8dhQ7BxUl6g"],"useful":17,"funny":7,"cool":7,"fans":1,"elite":["None"],"average_stars":4.35,"compliment_hot":2,"compliment_more":1,"compliment_profile":0,"compliment_cute":0,"compliment_list":0,"compliment_note":3,"compliment_plain":3,"compliment_cool":3,"compliment_funny":3,"compliment_writer":2,"compliment_photos":0,"type":"user"}}
