Yes it is a chain and usually chain places are not great but they're also not horrible. I tried it again recently since the hubby had never been there. We've just decided that we are never going back. everything was drenched in butter. Why did it take 45 minutes for our food to get there? I was so thirsty by the end of the evening because everything was so salty. Even the cooks messed up the <steak> order at the table next to us. This must be their way of making money on drinks. Save yourself the trip, if you're paying this much for mediocre seafood, might as well try a nicer place downtown.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review","restaurant":{"name":"Red Lobster","neighborhood":"","address":"4502 East Towne Blvd.","city":"Madison","state":"WI","postal_code":"53704","latitude":43.128034,"longitude":-89.307157,"stars":3.5,"review_count":38,"is_open":1,"attributes":["Alcohol: full_bar","Ambience: {'romantic': False, 'intimate': False, 'classy': False, 'hipster': False, 'divey': False, 'touristy': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'casual': True}","BikeParking: True","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards: True","BusinessParking: {'garage': False, 'street': False, 'validated': False, 'lot': True, 'valet': False}","Caters: False","GoodForKids: True","GoodForMeal: {'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': False, 'dinner': True, 'breakfast': False, 'brunch': False}","HasTV: True","NoiseLevel: average","OutdoorSeating: False","RestaurantsAttire: casual","RestaurantsDelivery: False","RestaurantsGoodForGroups: True","RestaurantsPriceRange2: 2","RestaurantsReservations: True","RestaurantsTableService: True","RestaurantsTakeOut: True","WheelchairAccessible: True","WiFi: no"],"categories":["Restaurants","Seafood","American (Traditional)"],"hours":["Monday 11:0-22:0","Tuesday 11:0-22:0","Wednesday 11:0-22:0","Thursday 11:0-22:0","Friday 11:0-23:0","Saturday 11:0-23:0","Sunday 11:0-22:0"],"type":"business"},"user":{"name":"Mya","review_count":4,"yelping_since":"2013-07-14","friends":["None"],"useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0,"fans":0,"elite":["None"],"average_stars":3.0,"compliment_hot":0,"compliment_more":0,"compliment_profile":0,"compliment_cute":0,"compliment_list":0,"compliment_note":0,"compliment_plain":0,"compliment_cool":0,"compliment_funny":0,"compliment_writer":0,"compliment_photos":0,"type":"user"}}
