The service staff is very good - attentive and professional.  We were in the Louise Marston room for the <cocktail> hour and dancing and the adjacent dining room for dinner.  The Louise Marston room is beautiful.  Periwinkle blue walls with elegant crown molding and crystal chandeliers that make the whole room sparkle.  If you are looking to host an event, this room is lovely.  I did rent chivari chairs and would recommend that to give an updated fresh look to the dining room - their chairs are fine, just nothing special.  Only bummer was that the <steak> we had at the tasting was a completely different cut than the night of our wedding.  (the <steak> the night of the reception was much more sinewy and a tad overdone)  I realize it is challenging with high numbers, but I was hoping it would have at least been the same type of cut.  Other than that, this club is a well oiled machine and aims to please.  And the bathrooms are gorgeous!  Favorite one is on first floor, but the second floor is pretty too.  If you are lucky enough to have friends who are members, hint at an invite!","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review","restaurant":{"name":"Madison Club","neighborhood":"Capitol","address":"5 E Wilson St","city":"Madison","state":"WI","postal_code":"53703","latitude":43.072474,"longitude":-89.380731,"stars":4.0,"review_count":16,"is_open":1,"attributes":["Alcohol: full_bar","Ambience: {'romantic': False, 'intimate': False, 'classy': False, 'hipster': False, 'divey': False, 'touristy': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'casual': False}","BikeParking: True","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards: True","BusinessParking: {'garage': False, 'street': False, 'validated': False, 'lot': False, 'valet': False}","Caters: True","CoatCheck: True","GoodForDancing: True","GoodForKids: False","GoodForMeal: {'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': False, 'dinner': False, 'breakfast': False, 'brunch': False}","HappyHour: True","HasTV: True","Music: {'dj': False, 'background_music': True, 'no_music': False, 'karaoke': False, 'live': False, 'video': False, 'jukebox': False}","NoiseLevel: quiet","OutdoorSeating: True","RestaurantsAttire: dressy","RestaurantsDelivery: False","RestaurantsGoodForGroups: True","RestaurantsPriceRange2: 4","RestaurantsReservations: True","RestaurantsTableService: True","RestaurantsTakeOut: False","WiFi: free"],"categories":["American (New)","Event Planning & Services","Restaurants","Nightlife","Venues & Event Spaces","Bars"],"hours":["Monday 7:0-23:0","Tuesday 7:0-23:0","Wednesday 7:0-23:0","Thursday 7:0-23:0","Friday 7:0-23:0","Saturday 8:0-13:0","Saturday 16:0-23:0"],"type":"business"},"user":{"name":"Andrea","review_count":13,"yelping_since":"2012-01-24","friends":["kmU_RUEGoYqlvFe51Apuug","ahn4nsH4cSk9GHyoBZK9sA","Y1DAv_S-z8MikviXlV5R1A","0XrA5IE3SQvZM_vWZ87EKQ","Pv5qxdcim1UWD2AlmBqGug","WmBtfsOCbeZnA2Ne51A09g","_U4qP46w3cZvlc8fEt71GA","gRsf9fv4xLvGkgHWbIfcqQ","T5Ess3PkVe49KezMzDreWw","76lJ-o2mTcgOxSZn2aBbTQ","5hn_L12ZphUldScE33nREw","2XZOfS5mem3NS8aFweDOgg","w_0oOSvxsQXFqYDgiRxDaw","gYUVQqAD_LJD_Xz-6Ff8cw","YvkC1WwGwRPAAy5DWWIzBA","MLXZe833F-5W4Sz8gC349w","5IDXP7tKW_CvkWWUXagHsA","xeBDq05p0jKUpPcd0atHrQ","5naHyBcFV7cndE69B34ggg","_gnt1DFtkNrRC30wA6AFXg","CXZWxyDkdXuKedlOLh-mRg","LUN_fBEq4vMjWUPMMTmv6g","w-X0BY5sermHSa89_-_WNQ","Dx6FKB-rb9imUAZHdWiB9w","ZB6z2MbyNS7WARt56xPSLg","d1OdZOaloOzPPNtzFiLXSg","m5GGI9Gdr6zRKLS_d23Dew","vZwqnHadlXD4eQ85nSlCxQ","ErpnF7ItYdGk3myKsz3QLw","eHfUoIb-5KXT1y5qA09p8Q","WSa4cV1su5gJSnSYY70fNA","vUxmYIYKMvS30FnJftw4VA","_Mqyd8zFhSzNnM2qX18Ymg","33m-2msGJ0fSJyKp6WFIsQ","WhvvIa6RIOR-lqxrn2gQtw","CaGQ6FJWHkm__Duty9iq0g","a_amzPmwoXWtL4eKhGa7-g","GUsGv0Bch8Lkj074pI7eVQ","WQmDA9eSSrdq6lqmUIr1Qg","530ly3zKE-CyE3-2KQBBAw","77_Or_oHTarlC0l_gcwdkA","YQq-GToh7a0yOBf9Ezd3Nw","IhU88ZRtsRp02zIakwQ-Ow","w3EiOVSXonhqXh0rP1dgVw","l4RsOrP9KnvKjIQcdBQznA","sayhcZ4IS31l8AHAwze9DA","WBR9DDXVBMWz7NLaxvsxyA"],"useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":1,"fans":0,"elite":["None"],"average_stars":4.23,"compliment_hot":0,"compliment_more":0,"compliment_profile":0,"compliment_cute":0,"compliment_list":0,"compliment_note":1,"compliment_plain":0,"compliment_cool":0,"compliment_funny":0,"compliment_writer":1,"compliment_photos":0,"type":"user"}}
