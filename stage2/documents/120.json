If you're looking for some great Mexican food, don't hesitate to stop and check this place out!\n\nOn both visits, I had the <Torta Chicken Sandwich> and it is awesome!  It's a very large portion of food with jalape\u00f1os, avocado, and a great salsa. This is one of my go to meals at Mexican restaurants when it's an available item on the menu. This one ranks right up there and I would highly recommend it. \n\nMy daughter has gotten the <quesadilla> both times and it is good, but don't expect your typically <quesadilla>. This one seems deep fried, which is a bit different than she is used too, but still tastes good. \n\nMy wife has gotten <tacos> and <tamales>, which are excellent as well.  <Chips and Salsa> are great!\n\nI honestly can't say a bad thing about the place.  Don't expect a fancy restaurant as its not at all, in fact it's a restaurant in the same building as a grocery store, but you can expect a great traditional Mexican meal!\n\nI can't wait until our next visit!","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review","restaurant":{"name":"Tienda Los Gemelos","neighborhood":"","address":"6713 Odana Rd, Ste 8","city":"Madison","state":"WI","postal_code":"53719","latitude":43.055999,"longitude":-89.4977688,"stars":4.5,"review_count":90,"is_open":1,"attributes":["Alcohol: full_bar","BikeParking: False","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards: True","BusinessParking: {'garage': False, 'street': False, 'validated': False, 'lot': True, 'valet': False}","Caters: False","GoodForKids: True","GoodForMeal: {'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': True, 'dinner': True, 'breakfast': False, 'brunch': False}","HasTV: True","NoiseLevel: average","OutdoorSeating: False","RestaurantsAttire: casual","RestaurantsDelivery: False","RestaurantsGoodForGroups: True","RestaurantsPriceRange2: 1","RestaurantsReservations: False","RestaurantsTableService: True","RestaurantsTakeOut: True","WiFi: no","Ambience: {'romantic': False, 'intimate': False, 'classy': False, 'hipster': False, 'divey': False, 'touristy': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'casual': True}"],"categories":["Food","Grocery","Restaurants","Mexican"],"hours":["Monday 9:0-21:0","Tuesday 9:0-21:0","Wednesday 9:0-21:0","Thursday 9:0-21:0","Friday 9:0-21:0","Saturday 9:0-21:0","Sunday 9:0-21:0"],"type":"business"},"user":{"name":"Jason","review_count":39,"yelping_since":"2010-09-23","friends":["JUT0U3HTSB3kz9Wh7N0GqA","wd3xoNaDLib8dhQ7BxUl6g"],"useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":1,"fans":0,"elite":["None"],"average_stars":3.85,"compliment_hot":2,"compliment_more":0,"compliment_profile":0,"compliment_cute":0,"compliment_list":0,"compliment_note":6,"compliment_plain":1,"compliment_cool":0,"compliment_funny":0,"compliment_writer":0,"compliment_photos":0,"type":"user"}}
