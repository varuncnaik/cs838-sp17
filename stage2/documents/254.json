We had shared an appetizer, so I didn't actually get around to eating the <waffles> until I got home.  The <waffles> were really bad.  One bite was almost entirely baking powder, so the batter had not been properly mixed or something.  Anyway, I emailed the Vintage to let them know.\n\nLater that week I got an email from the chef - he apologized and acknowledged the problem.  Additionally, he told me that my email had led him to totally rethink the dish and that if I wanted to come back and try the new version - it would be on the house.\n\nI just tried the new and improved <chicken & waffles> and I have to say they are the BEST I've ever had!\n\nThe new <waffles> are Belgian style and the chicken breading has been made slightly sweeter, more crunchy and lighter in color.  It seemed like the thigh meat had been cut thinner than before too, so the breading / meat ratio was higher.  The gravy was not thick anymore - it was sweeter and more buttery; a dramatic improvement!\n\nIf you've been disappointed by the C&W here before - now might be a good time to try again.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review","restaurant":{"name":"Vintage Brewing Co.","neighborhood":"","address":"674 S Whitney Way","city":"Madison","state":"WI","postal_code":"53719","latitude":43.0509492,"longitude":-89.4739301,"stars":3.5,"review_count":232,"is_open":1,"attributes":["Alcohol: full_bar","Ambience: {'romantic': False, 'intimate': False, 'classy': False, 'hipster': False, 'divey': False, 'touristy': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'casual': True}","BestNights: {'monday': False, 'tuesday': False, 'friday': True, 'wednesday': False, 'thursday': True, 'sunday': False, 'saturday': True}","BikeParking: True","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards: True","BusinessParking: {'garage': False, 'street': False, 'validated': False, 'lot': True, 'valet': False}","ByAppointmentOnly: False","Caters: True","CoatCheck: False","GoodForDancing: False","GoodForKids: True","GoodForMeal: {'dessert': False, 'latenight': True, 'lunch': True, 'dinner': True, 'breakfast': False, 'brunch': False}","HappyHour: True","HasTV: True","Music: {'dj': False, 'background_music': False, 'no_music': False, 'karaoke': False, 'live': False, 'video': False, 'jukebox': False}","NoiseLevel: average","OutdoorSeating: True","RestaurantsAttire: casual","RestaurantsDelivery: False","RestaurantsGoodForGroups: True","RestaurantsPriceRange2: 2","RestaurantsReservations: True","RestaurantsTableService: True","RestaurantsTakeOut: True","Smoking: no","WheelchairAccessible: True","WiFi: free"],"categories":["American (Traditional)","Bars","Nightlife","Food","Breweries","Restaurants"],"hours":["Monday 11:0-2:0","Tuesday 11:0-2:0","Wednesday 11:0-2:0","Thursday 11:0-2:0","Friday 11:0-2:0","Saturday 11:0-2:0","Sunday 11:0-2:0"],"type":"business"},"user":{"name":"Carl","review_count":3,"yelping_since":"2010-09-27","friends":["TZ09H4TaXoVXSHfO8W-nOA"],"useful":6,"funny":0,"cool":0,"fans":0,"elite":["None"],"average_stars":2.33,"compliment_hot":0,"compliment_more":0,"compliment_profile":0,"compliment_cute":0,"compliment_list":0,"compliment_note":0,"compliment_plain":0,"compliment_cool":0,"compliment_funny":0,"compliment_writer":0,"compliment_photos":0,"type":"user"}}
