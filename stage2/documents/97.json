We had to wait about 30 minutes to get in but it was a Sunday morning, so the wait was about what I was expecting. The espresso machine was broken, so I was unable to get a caf\u00e9 au lait. I asked the waitress for some extra milk instead--she just brought me cream, but since she also brought cream for my friend who asked for black coffee, it worked out for me. The French toast was good--I especially liked the amount of cinnamon and that the presence of bananas made the breakfast seem less unhealthy. But really, the French toast was just good, not fantastic. The bacon was fine, but not memorable. If rather go to Four and Twenty for breakfast if I have the choice.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review","restaurant":{"name":"Bassett Street Brunch Club","neighborhood":"Capitol","address":"444 W Johnson St","city":"Madison","state":"WI","postal_code":"53703","latitude":43.072731,"longitude":-89.393353,"stars":4.0,"review_count":330,"is_open":1,"attributes":["Alcohol: full_bar","Ambience: {'romantic': False, 'intimate': False, 'classy': False, 'hipster': False, 'divey': False, 'touristy': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'casual': True}","BikeParking: True","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards: True","BusinessParking: {'garage': False, 'street': False, 'validated': True, 'lot': True, 'valet': False}","Caters: True","GoodForKids: True","GoodForMeal: {'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': False, 'dinner': False, 'breakfast': True, 'brunch': True}","HasTV: True","NoiseLevel: average","OutdoorSeating: True","RestaurantsAttire: casual","RestaurantsDelivery: False","RestaurantsGoodForGroups: True","RestaurantsPriceRange2: 2","RestaurantsReservations: False","RestaurantsTableService: True","RestaurantsTakeOut: True","WheelchairAccessible: True","WiFi: free"],"categories":["Breakfast & Brunch","Restaurants"],"hours":["Monday 7:0-22:0","Tuesday 7:0-22:0","Wednesday 7:0-22:0","Thursday 7:0-0:0","Friday 7:0-0:0","Saturday 8:0-0:0","Sunday 8:0-22:0"],"type":"business"},"user":{"name":"T","review_count":19,"yelping_since":"2013-06-28","friends":["None"],"useful":1,"funny":1,"cool":0,"fans":2,"elite":["None"],"average_stars":4.0,"compliment_hot":0,"compliment_more":0,"compliment_profile":0,"compliment_cute":0,"compliment_list":0,"compliment_note":0,"compliment_plain":1,"compliment_cool":0,"compliment_funny":0,"compliment_writer":0,"compliment_photos":0,"type":"user"}}
