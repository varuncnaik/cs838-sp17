Although the food--the <walleye>, <scallops>, <beat salad>, <pasta dish>--was good to above-average, it was not on a par with several other of the better restaurants in Madison.  \n\nMore disappointing was that my mother-in-law had made the reservation indicating it was a special dinner for her 62d anniversary and specifically asked for and was assured a table by the windows. Well, of course, the ma\u00eetre-d refused to honor that request even though two tables sat empty during our entire meal!  Our waiter was very personable and competent but no one offered us a <wine> list until we asked for it twice.  \n\nIt may be unfair to compare the new with the old Edgewater, but we always thought the old Edgewater had a unique panache in that it served <steak diane> and <Caesar salad> at tableside and had a number of other very nice touches that made it a destination for many special occasions.  Not a whole lot is unique about the Statehouse.","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review","restaurant":{"name":"The Statehouse","neighborhood":"Capitol","address":"1001 Wisconsin Pl","city":"Madison","state":"WI","postal_code":"53703","latitude":43.0791895,"longitude":-89.3896863,"stars":3.0,"review_count":64,"is_open":1,"attributes":["Alcohol: full_bar","Ambience: {'romantic': False, 'intimate': False, 'classy': True, 'hipster': False, 'divey': False, 'touristy': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'casual': False}","BestNights: {'monday': False, 'tuesday': False, 'friday': True, 'wednesday': False, 'thursday': False, 'sunday': False, 'saturday': False}","BikeParking: True","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards: True","BusinessParking: {'garage': False, 'street': False, 'validated': False, 'lot': False, 'valet': True}","Caters: False","CoatCheck: True","GoodForDancing: False","GoodForKids: False","GoodForMeal: {'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': False, 'dinner': False, 'breakfast': False, 'brunch': False}","HappyHour: False","HasTV: True","Music: {'dj': False, 'background_music': True, 'no_music': False, 'karaoke': False, 'live': False, 'video': False, 'jukebox': False}","NoiseLevel: quiet","OutdoorSeating: True","RestaurantsAttire: casual","RestaurantsDelivery: False","RestaurantsGoodForGroups: True","RestaurantsReservations: True","RestaurantsTableService: True","RestaurantsTakeOut: False","WiFi: paid","RestaurantsPriceRange2: 3"],"categories":["American (Traditional)","Bars","Restaurants","American (New)","Nightlife"],"hours":["Monday 6:30-11:0","Monday 11:0-0:0","Tuesday 6:30-11:0","Tuesday 11:0-0:0","Wednesday 11:0-0:0","Thursday 11:0-0:0","Friday 6:30-11:0","Friday 11:0-0:0","Saturday 6:30-15:0","Sunday 6:30-15:0","Sunday 17:30-22:0"],"type":"business"},"user":{"name":"Kevin","review_count":2,"yelping_since":"2010-09-19","friends":["None"],"useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"fans":0,"elite":["None"],"average_stars":3.5,"compliment_hot":0,"compliment_more":0,"compliment_profile":0,"compliment_cute":0,"compliment_list":0,"compliment_note":0,"compliment_plain":0,"compliment_cool":0,"compliment_funny":0,"compliment_writer":0,"compliment_photos":0,"type":"user"}}
