There was just one table open that we were able to sit down at immediately. My fiance and I ordered the <mussels> (in wine) and the <walleye pan-seared>. We shared both. The <mussel> order was huge. With the <crostini> (I LOVE GOOD BREAD) and all of the <mussels>, I think we could have been satisfied with just that. They split the entree plate for us. I guess I am weird, I am probably one of the few people who would rather split it myself. Oh well, nothing to fret over. The <walleye> was cooked to perfection. Overall the food was good, the decor was cute, but it didn't WOW me like some places do. If I had the option I would have given it a 3.5 rating. It's definitely better than a 3 but not quite a 4. I think it was the menu. It was hard for us to find items that we REALLY wanted to try. That being said I would like to back on a less lively night and sit at the bar. We are bar sitting people! :)","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review","restaurant":{"name":"Off Broadway Drafthouse","neighborhood":"Waunona","address":"5404 Raywood Rd","city":"Madison","state":"WI","postal_code":"53713","latitude":43.0468733,"longitude":-89.3547473,"stars":3.5,"review_count":38,"is_open":1,"attributes":["Alcohol: full_bar","Ambience: {'romantic': False, 'intimate': False, 'classy': False, 'hipster': False, 'divey': False, 'touristy': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'casual': True}","BikeParking: True","BusinessAcceptsBitcoin: False","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards: True","BusinessParking: {'garage': False, 'street': True, 'validated': False, 'lot': True, 'valet': False}","Caters: False","CoatCheck: False","DriveThru: False","GoodForDancing: False","GoodForKids: True","GoodForMeal: {'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': False, 'dinner': False, 'breakfast': False, 'brunch': False}","HappyHour: False","HasTV: True","Music: {'dj': False, 'background_music': True, 'no_music': False, 'karaoke': False, 'live': False, 'video': False, 'jukebox': False}","NoiseLevel: loud","OutdoorSeating: True","RestaurantsAttire: casual","RestaurantsDelivery: False","RestaurantsGoodForGroups: True","RestaurantsPriceRange2: 2","RestaurantsReservations: False","RestaurantsTableService: True","RestaurantsTakeOut: True","Smoking: no","WheelchairAccessible: True","WiFi: free"],"categories":["American (Traditional)","Burgers","Bars","Comfort Food","Pubs","Nightlife","Restaurants"],"hours":["Tuesday 11:0-0:0","Wednesday 11:0-0:0","Thursday 11:0-0:0","Friday 11:0-0:0","Saturday 8:0-0:0","Sunday 8:0-0:0"],"type":"business"},"user":{"name":"Jenny","review_count":71,"yelping_since":"2011-04-22","friends":["wd3xoNaDLib8dhQ7BxUl6g","CvhlqMRs97TKlYdNzUXDGg","GVuU1qYR_pWFEVezVjm8hQ","gteHjytNuIQZTTjRyqGTyQ","JUT0U3HTSB3kz9Wh7N0GqA","R-sLLhHtMtIwEQ8f9rq3Qw","5ElMnvLAua7OtC7ft1fIlg"],"useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"fans":1,"elite":["2016","2017"],"average_stars":3.86,"compliment_hot":6,"compliment_more":0,"compliment_profile":0,"compliment_cute":0,"compliment_list":0,"compliment_note":3,"compliment_plain":2,"compliment_cool":7,"compliment_funny":7,"compliment_writer":4,"compliment_photos":0,"type":"user"}}
