The atmosphere was good. Service was good too. The food though was not good. I ordered the <lamb chops> and my friend ordered the <filet>. The <lamb chops> were okay. It's not that they didn't cook them well, it's just that the preparation was bad. The sauce that they came out in overpowered the meat. Each bite was a bit harder then the last. My friend said the <steak> had no flavor and was tough. With a good <filet>, you should be able to cut it with a fork. She said she needed to put effort in with the knife. \n\nOverall everything was okay. Why I give this restaurant a low review is because for how much everything costs we should have been amazed by the food. We were not. If you're in town looking for a good <steak>, look elsewhere.","useful":3,"funny":2,"cool":0,"type":"review","restaurant":{"name":"Tornado Steak House","neighborhood":"Capitol","address":"116 S Hamilton St","city":"Madison","state":"WI","postal_code":"53703","latitude":43.07243,"longitude":-89.38434,"stars":4.0,"review_count":360,"is_open":1,"attributes":["Alcohol: full_bar","Ambience: {'romantic': False, 'intimate': False, 'classy': True, 'hipster': False, 'divey': False, 'touristy': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'casual': False}","BYOB: False","BYOBCorkage: no","BikeParking: True","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards: True","BusinessParking: {'garage': False, 'street': True, 'validated': False, 'lot': False, 'valet': False}","Caters: False","GoodForKids: False","GoodForMeal: {'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': False, 'dinner': True, 'breakfast': False, 'brunch': False}","HasTV: False","NoiseLevel: average","OutdoorSeating: True","RestaurantsAttire: casual","RestaurantsDelivery: False","RestaurantsGoodForGroups: True","RestaurantsPriceRange2: 3","RestaurantsReservations: True","RestaurantsTableService: True","RestaurantsTakeOut: False","WheelchairAccessible: True","WiFi: no"],"categories":["Steakhouses","Restaurants","Italian","Burgers"],"hours":["Monday 17:0-1:0","Tuesday 17:0-1:0","Wednesday 17:0-1:0","Thursday 17:0-1:0","Friday 17:0-1:0","Saturday 17:0-1:0","Sunday 17:0-1:0"],"type":"business"},"user":{"name":"Matt","review_count":3,"yelping_since":"2012-12-26","friends":["r_Ff6jz-BjNewCRx796LiA","mUYHbN9HAdr2RHtrGJt4dA","Q98shcI__v0EQ47R9b-UWg","8SdXlrC23a7C51TR3NjoNw","To5bNkKpfslEZ2IZk4QC8A","il2-wJPO3h5tJxtSji3iFQ","NSOeFeQzUTVVUh-Bu-5ljg","traX2K3GDV1jEQK6Q_TMbA","Dd9BxLRmfuabd65u0jBdkw","lJ9A3VVKpbctbu0MHwEK8g","K2uW9Y5HDMcuflF6CMGv-w","jZpTe206kY6Kc3X2gbCOeg","Tk6kRzRKwZKZ_F50r3G5WQ","8xMaUrfvGPJGEq65psD-Pw"],"useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"fans":0,"elite":["None"],"average_stars":3.33,"compliment_hot":0,"compliment_more":0,"compliment_profile":0,"compliment_cute":0,"compliment_list":0,"compliment_note":0,"compliment_plain":0,"compliment_cool":0,"compliment_funny":0,"compliment_writer":0,"compliment_photos":0,"type":"user"}}
