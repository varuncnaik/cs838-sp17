In fact, it's pretty difficult to get a table in a reasonable amount of time during regular dining hours. Alas - we arrived about 10pm and got a 2-top right away. \n\nThe <Up-North Old Fashioned> is a classic made with Kessler's. Just order one and don't worry about it. If you are a <brandy> person, not to worry you can be accommodated. \n\nWe spilt the <Mac and Cheese with Bacon>. This is very cheesy and rich dish - but works well as something to share. Companion had the <chicken sandwich>, which came with bacon and cheese. I had the Friday night perch special. This was really pretty good. The batter was nice and crispy with a nice crunch. The fish itself was very mild with good flavor. \n\nI think the <fish specials> or the <fish sandwich> in general are good choices. The <Old Fashioned burger> is also good with bacon, cheese and a fried egg - but be careful this menu item is prone to be over cooked. When ordered medium rare it's tasty unless it comes out well done. This has happened to me enough times that I just won't order <burgers> of any kind at this restaurant. \n\nThe <beer> list is so big as to be obnoxious and overwhelming. If it's summer and they have the frozen <brandy> slush - just order one. \n\nI'd give this place 4-stars but the service can be iffy... If not sort of off putting - accommodations are rarely made for the customer, it is the way it is and if you prefer something else, this place isn't for you. This said the Old Fashioned is open late and serves late. A big bonus from my perspective. It's a local joint - of you follow my posts you know I'm passionate about eating locally - Just do it.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review","restaurant":{"name":"The Old Fashioned","neighborhood":"Capitol","address":"23 N Pinckney St","city":"Madison","state":"WI","postal_code":"53703","latitude":43.0761862475,"longitude":-89.3837572172,"stars":4.0,"review_count":1236,"is_open":1,"attributes":["Alcohol: full_bar","Ambience: {'romantic': False, 'intimate': False, 'classy': False, 'hipster': False, 'divey': False, 'touristy': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'casual': True}","BikeParking: True","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards: True","BusinessParking: {'garage': False, 'street': True, 'validated': False, 'lot': False, 'valet': False}","Caters: False","GoodForKids: True","GoodForMeal: {'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': True, 'dinner': True, 'breakfast': False, 'brunch': False}","HasTV: True","NoiseLevel: loud","OutdoorSeating: True","RestaurantsAttire: casual","RestaurantsCounterService: True","RestaurantsDelivery: False","RestaurantsGoodForGroups: True","RestaurantsPriceRange2: 2","RestaurantsReservations: False","RestaurantsTableService: True","RestaurantsTakeOut: True","WheelchairAccessible: False","WiFi: free"],"categories":["American (Traditional)","Restaurants","German","American (New)","Steakhouses","Bars","Breakfast & Brunch","Salad","Nightlife"],"hours":["Monday 7:30-22:30","Tuesday 7:30-0:0","Wednesday 7:30-1:0","Thursday 7:30-1:0","Friday 7:30-1:30","Saturday 9:0-1:30","Sunday 9:0-22:30"],"type":"business"},"user":{"name":"Eric","review_count":248,"yelping_since":"2013-09-11","friends":["yJP-54fC6lpYXXl5X0JyJw","hCzMNVI91XwodmhwaXQccA","d5WLqmTMvmL7-RmUDVKqqQ","UUqGHQFu2tQDGv5r3yJWPA","f7Emr9Q4H5r_jO_DW3QuIQ","adtOywpRnG5-4mjQMQE1FA","5ElMnvLAua7OtC7ft1fIlg","CVEN1qZqeWIri1CzeO8C8A","wd3xoNaDLib8dhQ7BxUl6g","NwXV_WofVAmhZjfQvu6y0w","xFvW2QLnxRtbHpw-04eiQA","e9bVxMuG-1NIJWqT_pDEmQ","FKclATu5-fmK6lsAUuHp7w","8teQ4Zc9jpl_ffaPJUn6Ew","tlQ2MDwfE1TBCNmsofeGfg","4q02ALXu_6i7-GWZAW9ctQ","nODk_1cOo7Y6ceMyPN1iZw","d7D4dYzF6THtOx9imf-wPw","wmJsu8F-82nLLxq2cNASOA","mUHJuirfyq3EsgNbhTkj2A","tbycp0aRhRsiAVYUAVR_uQ","DJH4hZrpXy5o3L7iZUe_8g","EhlbAnh3EAxbxEMZIOewcA","m-P9aaSngfBNuMTQZLekoQ","sOt8xtB7uGv61_Mb9YmKBg","aY1pbwrDLHHElTW-uU00_g","JUT0U3HTSB3kz9Wh7N0GqA"],"useful":37,"funny":9,"cool":29,"fans":2,"elite":["2015"],"average_stars":3.72,"compliment_hot":7,"compliment_more":1,"compliment_profile":0,"compliment_cute":0,"compliment_list":0,"compliment_note":11,"compliment_plain":6,"compliment_cool":15,"compliment_funny":15,"compliment_writer":5,"compliment_photos":3,"type":"user"}}
