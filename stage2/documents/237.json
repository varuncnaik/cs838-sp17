She gave the <soup> a try and was impressed - which says a lot to me because she is used to the best of the best Thai food living there. So she picked up a copy of their menu and brought it home to show us. \n\nI was impressed by the menu and we decided to order dinner for pick up there last week. When I went to pick up the food I was pleasantly surprised by the interior, it was welcoming and overall clean. The food was ready when they said it would be. \n\nI ordered the <yellow curry> with three items of your choice (I chose Thai eggplant, straw mushrooms and squash) and it was very tasty. The portion size was generous also. My mom ordered the <green curry> which was also quite delicious. My spouse ordered the <fried shrimp> and <Chicken Satay>. The <fried shrimp> was too greasy and not a big hit. The <chicken satay> comes with a random slice of toast, however, it actually goes well with the meal.\n\nThe <spring roll> appetizer I ordered was good, although I would have preferred it without the pork.\n\nI ordered a <Thai Ice Tea> to go which was also good. \n\nThis place has some of the better Thai food I have had in Madison and I am thankful it is in our neighborhood, I found the food more impressive than Sa Bai Thong's. I think it would be nice if they offered delivery in addition to take out. I also think the reason I hadn't visited the restaurant sooner, despite living nearby, is because the name made me think it was solely a noodle place not a Thai restaurant with non noodle options.","useful":2,"funny":1,"cool":1,"type":"review","restaurant":{"name":"Thai Noodles","neighborhood":"","address":"5957 Mckee Rd, Ste 3","city":"Fitchburg","state":"WI","postal_code":"53719","latitude":43.014973924,"longitude":-89.457883596,"stars":3.5,"review_count":80,"is_open":1,"attributes":["Alcohol: none","Ambience: {'romantic': False, 'intimate': False, 'classy': False, 'hipster': False, 'divey': False, 'touristy': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'casual': True}","BikeParking: True","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards: True","BusinessParking: {'garage': False, 'street': False, 'validated': False, 'lot': True, 'valet': False}","Caters: False","GoodForKids: True","HasTV: True","NoiseLevel: quiet","OutdoorSeating: False","RestaurantsAttire: casual","RestaurantsDelivery: False","RestaurantsGoodForGroups: True","RestaurantsPriceRange2: 2","RestaurantsReservations: False","RestaurantsTableService: True","RestaurantsTakeOut: True","WheelchairAccessible: False","WiFi: no","GoodForMeal: {'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': True, 'dinner': True, 'breakfast': False, 'brunch': False}"],"categories":["Restaurants","Thai","Noodles"],"hours":["Monday 10:0-21:0","Tuesday 10:0-21:0","Wednesday 10:0-21:0","Thursday 10:0-21:0","Friday 10:0-22:0","Saturday 10:0-22:0","Sunday 13:0-21:0"],"type":"business"},"user":{"name":"Demi","review_count":54,"yelping_since":"2009-07-23","friends":["wd3xoNaDLib8dhQ7BxUl6g","d5WLqmTMvmL7-RmUDVKqqQ","JQhOnIgDALdsXQkUwk7Z0A","e9bVxMuG-1NIJWqT_pDEmQ","hlFD_c_AyPTVsdqZrqrCyQ"],"useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"fans":4,"elite":["2017"],"average_stars":3.28,"compliment_hot":2,"compliment_more":0,"compliment_profile":0,"compliment_cute":0,"compliment_list":0,"compliment_note":3,"compliment_plain":3,"compliment_cool":1,"compliment_funny":1,"compliment_writer":1,"compliment_photos":0,"type":"user"}}
