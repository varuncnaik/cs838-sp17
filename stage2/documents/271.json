{"review_id":"Ji734oJn2EkBnxCZkiqyTA","user_id":"E37-dPSDSkKnT9cVzyNiLA","business_id":"3-HFGxmbzSax-NySJ_LzDg","stars":4,"date":"2016-01-31","text":"Definitely coming back here! This is one of the most relaxing places that I've been to in a while and their food was mostly spot on for my wife and I. We had starter <salads> w/ ginger dressing, <pork dumplings> in chili sauce, <hot and spicy beef with tofu>, and <fried rice w/ beef>.\n\nPositives:\n - They got us seated, drinks, and food pretty quickly.\n - Loved the <salads>, <dumplings>, and <fried rice>. All very well done.\n - The lighting is a soft blue and very relaxing.\n - The entire restaurant layout is very open and pleasant to look at.\n - Their bathrooms are clean, the decor is nice, and the lighting matches the rest of the place.\n - It was fairly busy for lunch on a Sunday. Enough so that walking in I had a feeling these people already knew something I didn't.\n - English obviously wasn't the waitresses first language, which made communication challenging at times, but she did a bang up job getting our orders out and caught when we needed refills.\n\nNegatives:\n - The <beef and tofu> was the only dish out of the lot that wasn't stellar. They'd definitely boiled the <beef and tofu> in the stew instead of letting them cook and firm up outside of it, which resulted in flavorless, soggy beef, and nearly liquid tofu.\n - The waitress had noticeably bad breath and it was a bit off-putting while I was eating. Might not have been her fault, but a stick of gum or a tic tac goes a long way when you're that close to people all day.\n\nAll-in-all I really enjoyed this place and I'm looking forward to going back again soon.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":1,"type":"review","restaurant":{"name":"VIP","neighborhood":"","address":"6718-6722 Odana Rd","city":"Madison","state":"WI","postal_code":"53719","latitude":43.0571089,"longitude":-89.49836,"stars":3.5,"review_count":150,"is_open":1,"attributes":["Alcohol: full_bar","BikeParking: True","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards: True","BusinessParking: {'garage': False, 'street': False, 'validated': False, 'lot': True, 'valet': False}","Caters: False","GoodForKids: True","GoodForMeal: {'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': True, 'dinner': True, 'breakfast': False, 'brunch': False}","HasTV: True","NoiseLevel: average","OutdoorSeating: False","RestaurantsAttire: casual","RestaurantsDelivery: False","RestaurantsGoodForGroups: True","RestaurantsPriceRange2: 2","RestaurantsReservations: True","RestaurantsTableService: True","RestaurantsTakeOut: True","WiFi: no","Ambience: {'romantic': False, 'intimate': False, 'classy': False, 'hipster': False, 'divey': False, 'touristy': False, 'trendy': True, 'upscale': False, 'casual': False}"],"categories":["Restaurants","Sushi Bars","Chinese","Japanese"],"hours":["Monday 11:0-15:0","Monday 16:30-22:0","Tuesday 11:0-15:0","Tuesday 16:30-22:0","Wednesday 11:0-15:0","Wednesday 16:30-22:0","Thursday 11:0-15:0","Thursday 16:30-22:0","Friday 11:0-22:30","Saturday 11:0-22:30","Sunday 12:0-22:0"],"type":"business"},"user":{"name":"Ben","review_count":4,"yelping_since":"2015-06-25","friends":["None"],"useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"fans":0,"elite":["None"],"average_stars":2.75,"compliment_hot":0,"compliment_more":0,"compliment_profile":0,"compliment_cute":0,"compliment_list":0,"compliment_note":0,"compliment_plain":0,"compliment_cool":0,"compliment_funny":0,"compliment_writer":0,"compliment_photos":0,"type":"user"}}
