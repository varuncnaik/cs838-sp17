Wowzers!  The downside is that the place is tiny - there's not really much room to wait in the restaurant or a bar to sit at.  The hostess asked for our phone number and politely advised that she would \"call when a table is ready\" which made me feel like we needed to leave and entertain ourselves for a spell.  The problem is the 20-25 minute wait isn't quite long enough to go somewhere else, get a beer, drink it, wondering when you're going to get a call and feel like you have to chug it down to get back there asap (since it's not like you're in the same place and can simply carry it back to your table).  Reservations are only accepted for groups of four or more and our waitress advised calling at least a day in advance. \n\nOnward and upward.  The menu included several <vegetarian rolls>, which I appreciated. The prices were average for <sushi> in the area, if not a wee bit higher. This is the first restaurant I've found around with shitake rolls on the menu (my favorite) so I was thrilled!  Unfortunately (like many of their veg rolls here) it was to be served in tempura batter.  Noo!  Don't drown the shitake!!  Fortunately, I asked the waitress for a simple, basic, plain <ol' shitake roll> (minus the tempura) and the chef obliged.  The first order got messed up (dipped in tempura batter anyways) but our waitress noticed and brought a plain shitake roll next.  This was great because we got to compare - and the plain one was great, you really got to taste the <shitake>, in the <tempura roll> it was also rolled with avocado which, along with the batter, essentially overpowered the mushroom.  Plain is the way to go and I appreciated the accommodating service! \n\nBOTTOM LINE: Charming service and good <shitake rolls> means I'll go back - I'll just try to get there even earlier!","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review","restaurant":{"name":"Red","neighborhood":"Capitol","address":"106 King
