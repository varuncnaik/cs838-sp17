It was nice and relaxing but a little too windy (we had to hold our <mimosas> (yum) tightly on the table for fear they would go flying into our neighboring table - next time I'll bring my crazy glue).  We had the <asparagus frittata with Gruyere cheese> with a <salad> and <cinnamon donut> as a side, the <Croquet Monsieur> (<ham & cheese sandwich with egg>) with <salad> and a side of their <Bacon Bread Pudding>.  All very yummy.  They serve small portions which is great (for me) but if you're looking for a hefty brunch this is not the place to go.  \n\nThe second time we came for brunch we sat inside by the window and had the <Poached Eggs Smoked Trout Casserole> and the <Pan Perdu> (<french toast>) with rhubarb, orange & creme fraiche compote with a side of the <Bacon Bread Pudding>.  All very good, but I didn't finish the <bread pudding> since I already had my fill of the <french toast>.  I wish they would have had a choice of fruit on their \"sides\" menu.  \n\nOn to the chocolate: like little pieces of beautiful art served and displayed on a cool slab of marble.  Fresh and delicious!","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review","restaurant":{"name":"CoCoLiquot","neighborhood":"Capitol","address":"225 King St","city":"Madison","state":"WI","postal_code":"53703","latitude":43.0744019,"longitude":-89.379518,"stars":3.5,"review_count":7,"is_open":0,"attributes":["BYOB: False","BYOBCorkage: yes_free","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards: True","BusinessParking: {'garage': False, 'street': True, 'validated': False, 'lot': False, 'valet': False}","Corkage: False","GoodForKids: False","GoodForMeal: {'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': False, 'dinner': False, 'breakfast': False, 'brunch': False}","RestaurantsAttire: dressy","RestaurantsDelivery: False","RestaurantsGoodForGroups: True","RestaurantsPriceRange2: 2","RestaurantsReservations: False","RestaurantsTableService: True","RestaurantsTakeOut: False","WheelchairAccessible: False"],"categories":["Restaurants"],"hours":null,"type":"business"},"user":{"name":"boots","review_count":33,"yelping_since":"2007-03-09","friends":["AHd1G_hAL7HG5xk8tzogmA","M1YMMS7FcggrMog8fL9h7Q","lXXlZVjjMEJh1vs0RLBn8A","MPozTU7MRVKYISO5prvzdg"],"useful":3,"funny":1,"cool":4,"fans":1,"elite":["None"],"average_stars":3.76,"compliment_hot":0,"compliment_more":1,"compliment_profile":1,"compliment_cute":0,"compliment_list":0,"compliment_note":1,"compliment_plain":1,"compliment_cool":0,"compliment_funny":0,"compliment_writer":1,"compliment_photos":1,"type":"user"}}
