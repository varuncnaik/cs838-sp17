The food arrived timely, and for six different lunch menu items, I was impressed.  The <ginger beef> was fragrant, just enough punch, and portion size was reasonable.  \n\nThe only complaint I have was getting our beverages refilled. They have such tiny <water> glasses and after about the fourth trip to the table, they finally dropped off a pitcher of <water>.  Not until they brought the check did they offer to refill any <sodas>.  I thought it was tacky to ask at this point since the glasses had been empty for at least half an hour.  \n\nOverall, prompt service (if you know me, I really hate to wait), good portion size, tasty food...
