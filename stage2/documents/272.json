In the past I thought the food was decent and the service was good (I would have given in 3 or maybe even 4 stars on previous visits), and I liked that it was locally owned/operated and seemed to be trying for authenticity.  However, on my last visit things seemed to have really gone downhill.\n\nAt my last visit to La Mestiza, my companion and I experienced cold tasteless food that was probably among the worst Mexican food we've had anywhere.  The dining room was also freezing and we had to wear our coats inside.   Besides the food, the worst part was the horrible service from our waiter who forgot our orders, never checked back, never refilled drinks, took ages to bring the bill, etc.  And then to top off a bad experience, we found out that the waiter will steal from you!\n\nI almost hate to recount this, because as I indicated, I did have decent experiences with La Mestiza during previous visits.  \n\nA few days after our visit, I noticed that the bill appearing on my charge card was for a different amount than I had authorized. \n\nI phoned and eventually got the manager, who said he would check into it.  He discovered that on my credit card slip the waiter had crossed out my tip and wrote in a bigger tip, apparently thinking that I would not notice!!!\n\nThe manager refunded me the extra few dollars and was nice about it.  While he didn't come out and say it, my impression was that this was not the first time this had occurred.  I will give him credit that he took care of the refund promptly and did apologize.  However, staff stealing from customers is unacceptable!\n\nI really hope that this experience was not the norm, as I know many people like this place, just as I used to.  I just hope they all pay cash or check their credit card charges after.","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review","restaurant":{"name":"La Mestiza","neighborhood":"","address":"6644 Odana Rd","city":"Madison","state":"WI","postal_code":"53719","latitude":43.056038,"longitude":-89.4941951,"stars":4.0,"review_count":141,"is_open":1,"attributes":["Alcohol: full_bar","Ambience: {'romantic': False, 'intimate': False, 'classy': False, 'hipster': False, 'divey': False, 'touristy': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'casual': True}","BikeParking: True","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards: True","BusinessParking: {'garage': False, 'street': False, 'validated': False, 'lot': True, 'valet': False}","Caters: True","GoodForKids: True","GoodForMeal: {'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': False, 'dinner': True, 'breakfast': False, 'brunch': False}","HasTV: False","NoiseLevel: average","OutdoorSeating: False","RestaurantsAttire: casual","RestaurantsDelivery: False","RestaurantsPriceRange2: 2","RestaurantsReservations: True","RestaurantsTableService: True","RestaurantsTakeOut: True","WheelchairAccessible: True","WiFi: free","RestaurantsGoodForGroups: True"],"categories":["Mexican","Restaurants"],"hours":["Monday 11:0-21:0","Tuesday 11:0-15:0","Tuesday 17:0-21:0","Wednesday 11:0-15:0","Wednesday 17:0-21:0","Thursday 11:0-15:0","Thursday 17:0-21:0","Friday 11:0-15:0","Friday 17:0-21:0","Saturday 11:0-22:0","Sunday 11:0-21:0"],"type":"business"},"user":{"name":"Jennifer","review_count":6,"yelping_since":"2010-02-03","friends":["None"],"useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0,"fans":0,"elite":["None"],"average_stars":2.5,"compliment_hot":0,"compliment_more":0,"compliment_profile":0,"compliment_cute":0,"compliment_list":0,"compliment_note":0,"compliment_plain":0,"compliment_cool":0,"compliment_funny":0,"compliment_writer":0,"compliment_photos":0,"type":"user"}}
