The awning is pretentious enough as is with the Chinese characters and I'll forgive the awful pun catchphrase, but I won't forgive the food.\n\nI'm going in there and I order <brocolli with chicken> and I get overcooked <rice> with this brown sauce that tastes like someone poured 10 cups of sugar. The brocolli is either raw or just severely undercooked. Now, I understand that Americanized Chinese food has the whole ketchup and sugar thing going on, but seriously, that place had a sauce that had the consistency of and tasted like maple syrup. On top of that, the food was overpriced -- $7 for a bowl of food with portions smaller than a coke can. A severe rip off!\n\nI really don't understand the appeal of this place, but whatever floats anyone's boat. If you're seriously digging the whole Americanized Chinese food thing, you're better off heading to Asian Kitchen or A8 instead; at least the food is properly cooked and the prices are more reasonable.","useful":3,"funny":2,"cool":0,"type":"review","restaurant":{"name":"Chin's Asia Fresh","neighborhood":"Capitol","address":"422 State St","city":"Madison","state":"WI","postal_code":"53703","latitude":43.075006,"longitude":-89.3921359,"stars":2.5,"review_count":16,"is_open":0,"attributes":["Alcohol: beer_and_wine","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards: True","BusinessParking: {'garage': False, 'street': False, 'validated': False, 'lot': False, 'valet': False}","GoodForKids: True","GoodForMeal: {'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': True, 'dinner': True, 'breakfast': False, 'brunch': False}","OutdoorSeating: False","RestaurantsAttire: casual","RestaurantsDelivery: True","RestaurantsGoodForGroups: True","RestaurantsPriceRange2: 1","RestaurantsReservations: False","RestaurantsTableService: False","RestaurantsTakeOut: True","WheelchairAccessible: True"],"categories":["Chinese","Restaurants"],"hours":null,"type":"business"},"user":{"name":"Roz","review_count":80,"yelping_since":"2009-04-16","friends":["m9xPOrdllT14YsZIgr-LHA","1XpvdPcTOHlx-eJe3cP8VA","CIZGlEw-Bp0rmkP8M6yQ9Q","SNvODfhVIIHxxXMuP4r-kQ","txgswBYUhPebQ6m0JfIGbg","jwbcs_eQ2QznrOyMuqz1LQ","JQhOnIgDALdsXQkUwk7Z0A","his70A8M4gUoR0oexuRtxA","oPgeKqfo5dUid0KvYuaehw"],"useful":18,"funny":30,"cool":9,"fans":1,"elite":["2011"],"average_stars":2.94,"compliment_hot":2,"compliment_more":1,"compliment_profile":1,"compliment_cute":0,"compliment_list":0,"compliment_note":4,"compliment_plain":4,"compliment_cool":3,"compliment_funny":3,"compliment_writer":2,"compliment_photos":0,"type":"user"}}
