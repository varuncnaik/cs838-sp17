The food was outstanding.  As often as we eat Indian cuisine, I am not good at describing most dishes by name.  What I can tell you is that the selections on the buffet were fresh, hot and deliciously seasoned.   Plus, there were several offerings on the buffet that I've never tried elsewhere.  It was nice to try something new.   The <tandoori chicken> was especially moist and meaty, not at all dry.   The spices in every dish were just right.   The only thing I found missing from the condiment section was the salty mixed relish that I enjoy on the side.  \n\nThis is a smaller-sized restaurant, and it was nice not to have to stand in a line to fill my plate.  Despite the smaller dining room, the size of the buffet and number of dishes offered was equivalent to both the larger Indian buffets we frequent. \n\nIf you are a fan of Indian buffets, you will be very pleased by the quality and selection!","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review","restaurant":{"name":"Minerva Indian Cuisine","neighborhood":"Junction Ridge","address":"515 Junction Rd","city":"Madison","state":"WI","postal_code":"53717","latitude":43.0714329016,"longitude":-89.5244802754,"stars":3.5,"review_count":65,"is_open":0,"attributes":["Alcohol: beer_and_wine","Ambience: {'romantic': False, 'intimate': False, 'classy': False, 'hipster': False, 'divey': False, 'touristy': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'casual': True}","BikeParking: True","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards: True","BusinessParking: {'garage': False, 'street': False, 'validated': False, 'lot': True, 'valet': False}","Caters: True","GoodForKids: True","GoodForMeal: {'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': True, 'dinner': True, 'breakfast': False, 'brunch': False}","HasTV: False","NoiseLevel: quiet","OutdoorSeating: False","RestaurantsAttire: casual","RestaurantsDelivery: False","RestaurantsGoodForGroups: True","RestaurantsPriceRange2: 2","RestaurantsReservations: True","RestaurantsTableService: True","RestaurantsTakeOut: True","WiFi: no"],"categories":["Restaurants","Indian"],"hours":["Monday 11:30-14:30","Monday 17:0-22:0","Tuesday 11:30-14:30","Tuesday 17:0-22:0","Wednesday 11:30-14:30","Wednesday 17:0-22:0","Thursday 11:30-14:30","Thursday 17:0-22:0","Friday 17:0-22:30","Saturday 12:0-15:0","Saturday 17:0-22:30","Sunday 12:0-15:0","Sunday 17:0-21:30"],"type":"business"},"user":{"name":"Rosie","review_count":13,"yelping_since":"2010-03-07","friends":["None"],"useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"fans":0,"elite":["None"],"average_stars":4.31,"compliment_hot":0,"compliment_more":0,"compliment_profile":0,"compliment_cute":0,"compliment_list":0,"compliment_note":2,"compliment_plain":0,"compliment_cool":0,"compliment_funny":0,"compliment_writer":0,"compliment_photos":0,"type":"user"}}
