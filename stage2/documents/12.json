Dined here with a pre-ordered party of 20.  Food was ready for us--laid out on a table next to our party and getting COLD.  One not very articulate server made for even more difficulties--it's not as if his job was really hard, the order was already made he just had to hand it out courteously.  I was here once before on salsa night-wasn't too impressed either.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":1,"type":"review","restaurant":{"name":"Frida","neighborhood":"Capitol","address":"117 State St","city":"Madison","state":"WI","postal_code":"53703","latitude":43.0747377,"longitude":-89.3874429,"stars":2.0,"review_count":50,"is_open":0,"attributes":["Alcohol: full_bar","Ambience: {'romantic': False, 'intimate': False, 'classy': False, 'hipster': False, 'divey': False, 'touristy': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'casual': False}","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards: True","BusinessParking: {'garage': True, 'street': True, 'validated': False, 'lot': False, 'valet': False}","GoodForKids: False","GoodForMeal: {'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': False, 'dinner': True, 'breakfast': False, 'brunch': False}","HasTV: True","NoiseLevel: average","OutdoorSeating: True","RestaurantsAttire: casual","RestaurantsDelivery: False","RestaurantsGoodForGroups: True","RestaurantsPriceRange2: 2","RestaurantsReservations: True","RestaurantsTableService: True","RestaurantsTakeOut: False","WheelchairAccessible: True"],"categories":["Mexican","Restaurants"],"hours":["Monday 11:0-22:0","Tuesday 11:0-22:0","Wednesday 11:0-22:0","Thursday 11:0-22:0","Friday 11:0-22:0","Saturday 8:0-22:0","Sunday 10:0-22:0"],"type":"business"},"user":{"name":"Nue","review_count":84,"yelping_since":"2006-07-14","friends":["rOlpEAZyno1yILC3Lj35iQ","dBSI69kcOlfhAw5a0OggFw","BTEHG5T-uEuTgmOdQJD7Pw","uR7808jHXnpYeuJZi_bkIQ","qvASKsvy8Thz7-TQPTvd2g","zDjtpwVPOJhQuQeIXAE-0A","aHl-3UItyhhS9P40Nr9EaA","aCaWGbG_xNc0Kjz-GvnF0w","qek4CkRvNCxdWYTO4lNK5Q","8QYRuRp8Z4oafqyFCsfveQ","GcWncDPCBLzvmvPIUF9D5w","PFmptE4gy6NvEcFUBq9Niw","EKjpxH__JX8Y2dqhtcUksQ","J0PBySg5EQTd_RxWI-cDcQ","YAXv8h7eD9xaI1aWvciMSw","F6WqpBvg8y5vVAFzh3SVsQ","UeiNCl0HrCLknuTMsS0OZA","_qYVe70SiK7bQ-IxE-yIYQ","S207oRfKTlF1FEaEYkRR8g","IDVX4Is4CanREchBmpFXoA","x8s3NGVGORsK9_FovlUCIg","nEwaBIELZIXXakxt2igyiA","NK-zIxHMuTnLRU0RhoZWqw","5v8D3YsyhsImEq7s-DrIAQ","ICwMfseYkrB0ZEK8tDUOHw","sgTNHoh04BaPE3xMVpFCDQ","oedIFmYQViZ9F2F-dvDNMg","fuoYjsuU7qy1RlCMEZ0xfA","f_9vplGy72m-ZSz80gZBiA","om5ZiponkpRqUNa3pVPiRg","fbpjEkaALuGJo_dCYWPYRQ","cFQDeYUQXXx2iUfyOvO6ig","GGWjA8v479feCo6OPTLQOg","PQ_aMj7ACwd4qNoNLAl6tg","Oy2z5gVLTC5BaOKyqXE-Jw","VSFQzBCgfOtnb6QmEqU4Sw","2yLD3esBneRzDI4Uh26q-A","BnLFYUzUnPYgDhazfQua-w","qPQX5D6QYH3dRlBozadfQA","09BJpVP_xfzShhhdoYj-HQ","fQq-PBKARvUGfBnmch9Dqg","_cUtxCvCccwgNJzD5I0cDA","c_EibMiN4RFyH_EfyyHepA","uAa2Hu6XtuUPxX_B3uS8Aw","77vChS-bKAkYnFT67iT0tg","G0FGeAGBj7IUFgCidXaSqg","QVVCwVW4xrGInBXq8jHyoQ","IK52Vfw_S82M3TW0rDDJMA","cg1dy5TAFK-be7iU4O53tg","lXXlZVjjMEJh1vs0RLBn8A","Nqz-ZM5kNNY61dhNaqwcMA","ef_cOqHQxl2a6R0zxxKIsg","atqYHKM-o-gkfqnGu3vedw","kZP6rPzWvsCx_2QMdkrybQ","3L7nHnaeSHSdZXzV_vdvAQ","uCfP3HkQ3BStwfqEVwvMOg","yiKD2EiVB-RoxecZnz1t3Q","5U7XCK3Oy5cKVI9rZncPNg","tXVCCVjyDy6nvj-EILbmEg","yPmlM7fxm6H4u3kFdvdHbw","5Kbn1FjXmS7Jypz3_ybt_Q","5oM7gXmeX7s6T1_KlL30yQ","6iKb3STG4vmvwS5AtFMrjg","4LZC5dQPwwMj7VflY5Bqmg"],"useful":7,"funny":6,"cool":5,"fans":2,"elite":["2008"],"average_stars":3.37,"compliment_hot":4,"compliment_more":2,"compliment_profile":0,"compliment_cute":0,"compliment_list":1,"compliment_note":3,"compliment_plain":7,"compliment_cool":7,"compliment_funny":7,"compliment_writer":2,"compliment_photos":0,"type":"user"}}
