First, it was extremely crowded and minimal seating. There were only 3 people working and service was poor. My friend and I ordered the <frittata> and it came extremely runny in the middle. The eggs were barely cooked and the dish was hardly warm. We proceeded to politely tell one of the waitress and they responded telling us they were pre cooked eggs and that it shouldn't be a problem. I however do not feel comfortable eating eggs that appear runny. She then ASKED if we wanted our money back after telling her we would just leave. I'm sorry but it shouldn't have been a question if we wanted our money back, I felt they should have said we will give you your money back or you can pick another menu item for free. After waiting for another 15 minutes we were able to get refunded. again, I don't normally complain or make a scene but the service and food was a huge disappointment.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review","restaurant":{"name":"Yola's Cafe","neighborhood":"","address":"494 Commerce Dr","city":"Madison","state":"WI","postal_code":"53719","latitude":43.0554282,"longitude":-89.5231822,"stars":3.5,"review_count":70,"is_open":1,"attributes":["Alcohol: none","Ambience: {'romantic': False, 'intimate': False, 'classy': False, 'hipster': False, 'divey': False, 'touristy': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'casual': True}","BikeParking: True","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards: True","BusinessParking: {'garage': False, 'street': False, 'validated': False, 'lot': True, 'valet': False}","Caters: True","GoodForKids: True","GoodForMeal: {'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': False, 'dinner': False, 'breakfast': True, 'brunch': True}","HasTV: False","NoiseLevel: average","OutdoorSeating: True","RestaurantsAttire: casual","RestaurantsDelivery: True","RestaurantsGoodForGroups: True","RestaurantsPriceRange2: 1","RestaurantsReservations: False","RestaurantsTableService: False","RestaurantsTakeOut: True","WheelchairAccessible: True","WiFi: free"],"categories":["Cafes","Coffee & Tea","Bakeries","Food","Breakfast & Brunch","Restaurants"],"hours":["Monday 7:0-16:30","Tuesday 7:0-16:30","Wednesday 7:0-16:30","Thursday 7:0-16:30","Friday 7:0-16:30","Saturday 7:0-16:30"],"type":"business"},"user":{"name":"Carissa","review_count":14,"yelping_since":"2013-02-15","friends":["None"],"useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0,"fans":0,"elite":["None"],"average_stars":3.86,"compliment_hot":0,"compliment_more":0,"compliment_profile":0,"compliment_cute":0,"compliment_list":0,"compliment_note":1,"compliment_plain":0,"compliment_cool":0,"compliment_funny":0,"compliment_writer":0,"compliment_photos":0,"type":"user"},"fvs":[{"length":33,"ends_with_s":0,"has_cooking_style":0,"ends_with_common_food_names":0,"has_restaurant_name":0,"sentence_contains_adjective_words":0,"is_prev_word_a_definite_artice":0,"contains_the":0,"example_word_length":6,"capital":0,"word_fraction_capitalized":0,"is_positive":0,"text":"only 3 people working and service"},{"length":10,"ends_with_s":0,"has_cooking_style":0,"ends_with_common_food_names":0,"has_restaurant_name":0,"sentence_contains_adjective_words":0,"is_prev_word_a_definite_artice":1,"contains_the":0,"example_word_length":1,"capital":0,"word_fraction_capitalized":0,"is_positive":1,"text":"frittata"},{"length":19,"ends_with_s":0,"has_cooking_style":0,"ends_with_common_food_names":0,"has_restaurant_name":0,"sentence_contains_adjective_words":0,"is_prev_word_a_definite_artice":0,"contains_the":1,"example_word_length":4,"capital":0,"word_fraction_capitalized":0,"is_positive":0,"text":"cooked and the dish"},{"length":8,"ends_with_s":0,"has_cooking_style":0,"ends_with_common_food_names":0,"has_restaurant_name":0,"sentence_contains_adjective_words":0,"is_prev_word_a_definite_artice":0,"contains_the":0,"example_word_length":2,"capital":0,"word_fraction_capitalized":0,"is_positive":0,"text":"tell one"},{"length":10,"ends_with_s":0,"has_cooking_style":0,"ends_with_common_food_names":0,"has_restaurant_name":0,"sentence_contains_adjective_words":0,"is_prev_word_a_definite_artice":0,"contains_the":0,"example_word_length":2,"capital":0,"word_fraction_capitalized":0,"is_positive":0,"text":"a question"},{"length":4,"ends_with_s":0,"has_cooking_style":0,"ends_with_common_food_names":0,"has_restaurant_name":0,"sentence_contains_adjective_words":0,"is_prev_word_a_definite_artice":0,"contains_the":0,"example_word_length":1,"capital":0,"word_fraction_capitalized":0,"is_positive":0,"text":"free"},{"length":5,"ends_with_s":0,"has_cooking_style":0,"ends_with_common_food_names":0,"has_restaurant_name":0,"sentence_contains_adjective_words":0,"is_prev_word_a_definite_artice":0,"contains_the":0,"example_word_length":2,"capital":0,"word_fraction_capitalized":0,"is_positive":0,"text":"don t"}]}
