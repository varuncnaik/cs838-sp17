The portions are huge. I've never eaten here and not had left overs. My fiance and I usually get the <mango curry with tofu> and the <pad thai with chicken> and split them. The <pad thai> isn't like typical <pad thai> in that it's not heavy on the peanuts, but I like it. Last time we went, it was just the two of us and we didn't get anything to drink (just <water>) and the bill was about $18. Seriously, the prices are amazing. They have a HUGE menu -- it's actually a bit overwhelming, but should suit everyone's taste. Definitely try the appetizers. I've had all the various rolls, and they'll all good and of course, large portions.\n\nThe service is a bit slow, especially during peak dinner time. But, when the food comes out, it's always so hot and fresh so I never feel bad about waiting because I know the food quality is great.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review","restaurant":{"name":"Ha Long Bay Vietnamese & Thai Bistro","neighborhood":"Williamson - Marquette","address":"1353 Williamson
