It was really busy when we ate there and we had a different server showing up to our table when we ordered, the brought out food and refills, etc. Service was still fast and they were friendly. I had the <Lake Side Roll> which had king crab, caviar, avocado and shrimp. When they brought it out it had four big piles of roe on each piece, all ditfferent colors. \nIt was a nice looking dish. I liked almost all of them, expect the green one hit me right in the nose with a pungent wasabi flavor. I probably should have seen that one coming based off the color. My husband had the <Dynamite Roll> which is a deep fried roll with  spicy tuna, yellowtail, cream cheese, avocado and baked scallop with crab meat. He really enjoyed and I might be trying  that roll the next time I go. We also had a couple of pieces of <ebi> and <tuna> <sushi>, both were very decent.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review","restaurant":{"name":"Takumi Japanese
