She gave the <soup> a try and was impressed - which says a lot to me because she is used to the best of the best Thai food living there. So she picked up a copy of their menu and brought it home to show us. \n\nI was impressed by the menu and we decided to order dinner for pick up there last week. When I went to pick up the food I was pleasantly surprised by the interior, it was welcoming and overall clean. The food was ready when they said it would be. \n\nI ordered the <yellow curry> with three items of your choice (I chose Thai eggplant, straw mushrooms and squash) and it was very tasty. The portion size was generous also. My mom ordered the <green curry> which was also quite delicious. My spouse ordered the <fried shrimp> and <Chicken Satay>. The <fried shrimp> was too greasy and not a big hit. The <chicken satay> comes with a random slice of toast, however, it actually goes well with the meal.\n\nThe <spring roll> appetizer I ordered was good, although I would have preferred it without the pork.\n\nI ordered a <Thai Ice Tea> to go which was also good. \n\nThis place has some of the better Thai food I have had in Madison and I am thankful it is in our neighborhood, I found the food more impressive than Sa Bai Thong's. I think it would be nice if they offered delivery in addition to take out. I also think the reason I hadn't visited the restaurant sooner, despite living nearby, is because the name made me think it was solely a noodle place not a Thai restaurant with non noodle options.","useful":2,"funny":1,"cool":1,"type":"review","restaurant":{"name":"Thai Noodles","neighborhood":"","address":"5957 Mckee Rd, Ste
