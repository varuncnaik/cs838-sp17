{"review_id":"9dg5bO9XDPWYpc8V4-Qzdg","user_id":"lzorGgTVQTkW5j9l6O9KXg","business_id":"84WYW7OfV-IXUJk95EL5_Q","stars":3,"date":"2012-12-18","text":"I'll get the easy part out of the way. The food is excellent. The bounty available on the <buffet> astounded me both in variety and how good it was. The same goes for the r\u00f4tisserie meats offered, plus the carvers had great timing regarding the gap between coming to the table and the sequence of who brought what.\n\nNow on to why I deducted two stars. I deduct one for layout of the establishment. You walk into what looks like the foyer of a former house, but there is no host stand in sight. (It turns out it is upstairs in front of the main dining room.) There is what looks like the bar/waiting room in a room straight ahead of that. It is a lounge that bears the Samba name but apparently functions separately from the restaurant. Indeed, other couples wandered in and asked the bartender about table availability, etc., only to be told to go upstairs. Another star is lost to further disorgainzation amongst the waitstaff when we got upstairs. There looked to be plenty of tables open, yet we were told to wait at the bar for about half an hour. The main problem appeared to be a lack of communication between the parts of the service staff, and that only continued when we finally sat. The carvers were timely, but the waitress responsible for our drinks, clearing plates, etc., was not very attentive. The right hand did not seem to know what the left hand was doing.\n\nIn sum, great food but confused service.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review","restaurant":{"name":"Samba Brazilian
