It was a game day, but they have no TV's there so it didn't get crowded until afterward. The space is open and airy and their <beers> are top notch. Our servers were very friendly but once the game was over and the crowds surged in the service was a tad slow. The food was OK, but it's a brew pub and I didn't expect a gourmet meal anyway. The only complaint I had was the obnoxious amount of douchebag parents-about-town who had their enormous baby carriers and bags of Cheerios and spit-rags clogging up the dining area. This place is about <beer>, and the other patrons don't want to hear your bitch-ass crotchfruit screeching and whining while you try to ignore them over a pint. Leave your shitty children at home. This isn't Chuck E Cheese.
