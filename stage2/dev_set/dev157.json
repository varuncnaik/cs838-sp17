At times, the <house red wine> has been nearly undrinkable, and I'm pretty easy to please with <wine>. I ate dinner there with a group of 6 about a year ago, and we all agreed that the seafood did not taste fresh at all and the dishes were not creative or really very flavorful. I probably should have learned my lesson, but I went back recently to try their happy hour <oysters>. I received a plate of <east coast oysters>, many of which were so small that they didn't even appear to have anything in the shell. Most places would give these away as an extra on the plate for free. \n\nIt's too bad- this place has great ambiance, and they usually have a good tap list of <beers>, but don't bet on the food. I'm amazed at the rave reviews I always see...","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review","restaurant":{"name":"Sardine","neighborhood":"Williamson - Marquette","address":"617 Williamson
