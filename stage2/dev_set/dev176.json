There is not a lot of room to wait for your party even around the bar.  I would not recommend Jac's for large parties.  When we were seated, I would describe it a cramped.  We were so close to another table of 4, we asked them if they wanted to join us.   My wife had her purse on her chair and the waitress asked her to put it on the floor or to hang it somewhere away from where she was sitting.  My wife declined on both requests.  We were able to put it on the back of my chair since that was \"less in the way\".  Their <beer> selection is just OK, although everything I saw was 6.8% ABV or more.  While appreciate many different types of <beer>, I would have liked to have seen a lighter selection for the warmer months.  For one person in our party, it took them 3 times to get his drink right and in that process one of his drinks was spilled on my wife.  While they apologized, there was no offer of any kind of restitution or an offer of a complimentary drink.  \n\nOur food order took FOREVER.  It had to be at least a half hour from order to service.  We were seated just after 6:30 and our food arrived just before 8.  I will say that the food was to temperature, but was just \"OK\".  I had the <Jac's classic burger> and my wife had the <Chicken Francaise> which she said could have used more sauce.  One of our friends had the <Moules et Frites> which was a good portion and were good.  Due to the way the table was arranged and the noise, I don't know how the other entrees were.  Also be aware that this item - <BACON BLEU BURGER> - while listed on their online menu is no longer on the menu when you arrive or at least it wasn't when we went.  It appears to have been replaced by a <Cheddar BBQ Burger>\n\nWe were warned that they do not split checks for groups larger than 6.  But you could give the waitress different credit cards to pay for portions of one check?  This practice is lame.  We get to sit around the table trying to figure out who owes how much and then determine if it will cover the check....blah, blah, blah.  I do not know why this is a practice, but if you are worried about your 18% Gratuity, then just allow the separate checks and state that 18% Gratuity will be added to each check for parties of 6 or more where the checks are separate...Problem Solved.  You have a POS system that will handle this very easily.  It seemed, in our opinion, that this place is run with an attitude of whatever is convenient for \"Jac\" is how we do things.\n\nWhile others may find a reason to return, we will not be going back.","useful":0,"funny":1,"cool":0,"type":"review","restaurant":{"name":"Jacs Dining and Tap House","neighborhood":"Dudgeon-Monroe","address":"2611 Monroe
