I've ordered from this Jimmy John's a few  times previously in hopes that the order errors, bad service and ridiculous wait times for delivery were a fluke,  but they're not. I don't think the management is paying attention.The staff themselves are mostly pleasant, but the <subs> I ordered continuously came out wrong. The only thing I don't want on my <sub> is tomatoes and have ordered them that way, but often I find that there are tomatoes, extra ingredients or missing ingredients on my sub. When calling in for delivery I've been given wait times of 10-20 minutes, only to wait for 45 minutes or an hour. The final straw was when I found additional charges on my receipt the last time I ordered that no one could explain and no offer to refund myster charges either. If you want what you order and expect it to be close to on time, eat somewhere else.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review","restaurant":{"name":"Jimmy John's","neighborhood":"","address":"635 S Main St","city":"De Forest","state":"WI","postal_code":"53532","latitude":43.2391694807,"longitude":-89.3425959206,"stars":2.5,"review_count":3,"is_open":1,"attributes":["Alcohol: none","Ambience: {'romantic': False, 'intimate': False, 'classy': False, 'hipster': False, 'divey': False, 'touristy': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'casual': False}","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards: True","Caters: True","GoodForKids: False","HasTV: False","NoiseLevel: average","OutdoorSeating: False","RestaurantsAttire: casual","RestaurantsDelivery: True","RestaurantsPriceRange2: 1","RestaurantsReservations: False","RestaurantsTableService: False","RestaurantsTakeOut: True","RestaurantsGoodForGroups: True","BikeParking: False","GoodForMeal: {'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': False, 'dinner': False, 'breakfast': False, 'brunch': False}"],"categories":["Restaurants","Food","Delis","Sandwiches","Food Delivery Services"],"hours":["Monday 10:0-20:0","Tuesday 10:0-20:0","Wednesday 10:0-20:0","Thursday 10:0-20:0","Friday 10:0-20:0","Saturday 11:0-15:0"],"type":"business"},"user":{"name":"Sherry","review_count":1,"yelping_since":"2013-01-22","friends":["None"],"useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"fans":0,"elite":["None"],"average_stars":1.0,"compliment_hot":0,"compliment_more":0,"compliment_profile":0,"compliment_cute":0,"compliment_list":0,"compliment_note":1,"compliment_plain":0,"compliment_cool":0,"compliment_funny":0,"compliment_writer":0,"compliment_photos":0,"type":"user"},"fvs":[{"length":15,"ends_with_s":0,"has_cooking_style":0,"ends_with_common_food_names":0,"has_restaurant_name":1,"sentence_contains_adjective_words":0,"is_prev_word_a_definite_artice":0,"contains_the":0,"example_word_length":3,"capital":0,"word_fraction_capitalized":0,"is_positive":0,"text":"this Jimmy John"},{"length":19,"ends_with_s":0,"has_cooking_style":0,"ends_with_common_food_names":0,"has_restaurant_name":0,"sentence_contains_adjective_words":0,"is_prev_word_a_definite_artice":0,"contains_the":0,"example_word_length":3,"capital":0,"word_fraction_capitalized":0,"is_positive":0,"text":"times previously in"},{"length":25,"ends_with_s":1,"has_cooking_style":0,"ends_with_common_food_names":0,"has_restaurant_name":0,"sentence_contains_adjective_words":0,"is_prev_word_a_definite_artice":0,"contains_the":1,"example_word_length":5,"capital":0,"word_fraction_capitalized":0,"is_positive":0,"text":"t think the management is"},{"length":6,"ends_with_s":0,"has_cooking_style":0,"ends_with_common_food_names":0,"has_restaurant_name":0,"sentence_contains_adjective_words":0,"is_prev_word_a_definite_artice":1,"contains_the":0,"example_word_length":1,"capital":0,"word_fraction_capitalized":0,"is_positive":1,"text":"subs"},{"length":20,"ends_with_s":0,"has_cooking_style":0,"ends_with_common_food_names":0,"has_restaurant_name":0,"sentence_contains_adjective_words":0,"is_prev_word_a_definite_artice":0,"contains_the":1,"example_word_length":5,"capital":1,"word_fraction_capitalized":0,"is_positive":0,"text":"The only thing I don"},{"length":5,"ends_with_s":0,"has_cooking_style":0,"ends_with_common_food_names":0,"has_restaurant_name":0,"sentence_contains_adjective_words":0,"is_prev_word_a_definite_artice":0,"contains_the":0,"example_word_length":1,"capital":0,"word_fraction_capitalized":0,"is_positive":1,"text":"sub"},{"length":21,"ends_with_s":1,"has_cooking_style":0,"ends_with_common_food_names":0,"has_restaurant_name":0,"sentence_contains_adjective_words":0,"is_prev_word_a_definite_artice":0,"contains_the":0,"example_word_length":6,"capital":0,"word_fraction_capitalized":0,"is_positive":0,"text":"t want on my sub is"},{"length":28,"ends_with_s":0,"has_cooking_style":0,"ends_with_common_food_names":0,"has_restaurant_name":0,"sentence_contains_adjective_words":0,"is_prev_word_a_definite_artice":1,"contains_the":0,"example_word_length":6,"capital":0,"word_fraction_capitalized":0,"is_positive":0,"text":"final straw was when I found"},{"length":23,"ends_with_s":0,"has_cooking_style":0,"ends_with_common_food_names":0,"has_restaurant_name":0,"sentence_contains_adjective_words":0,"is_prev_word_a_definite_artice":0,"contains_the":1,"example_word_length":5,"capital":0,"word_fraction_capitalized":0,"is_positive":0,"text":"receipt the last time I"},{"length":27,"ends_with_s":0,"has_cooking_style":0,"ends_with_common_food_names":0,"has_restaurant_name":0,"sentence_contains_adjective_words":0,"is_prev_word_a_definite_artice":0,"contains_the":0,"example_word_length":5,"capital":0,"word_fraction_capitalized":0,"is_positive":0,"text":"on time eat somewhere else"}]}
