Every once in a while we get lucky and stumble upon a place we wish we knew about. My visit to Laz Bistro was one of those experiences.  Will begin with the food, after all that is why we go out to eat. I had the <ribs> while my dining partner had pulled pork. The <ribs> were smoked to perfection. They use a dry kc style rub, which leaves you to eat great food without messy fingers. I've had my share of ribs, these stood above the others by far. Then i moved on to the beans. What a wonderful combination of <baked beans> with a little bite married with the sweet flavor of apple. Then you when you think you've enjoyed the taste, you crunch a pecan. The side was the surprise of the night.\nThis place is a bit cozy, and the waitress was kind enough to tell us the importance of reservations on show nights at the opera house. Since I already mentioned the waitress, let me tell you how outstanding she was. To her, it was obvious it wasn't a job, but a service she was providing and that she cared about the long term success of the restaurant.   How do I know this? When was the last time, at the conclusion of you meal, did your waitress bring a carry out menu, stress how all meals are prepared to order, how when we come back we should request food to be prepared how we want it, leaving or adding any ingredient we wish? They will make any dish vegetarian or gluten free if asked. I can not stress how much you need to visit. This is a dining experience you will not find elsewhere.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review","restaurant":{"name":"Laz Bistro and Bar","neighborhood":"","address":"419 E Main
