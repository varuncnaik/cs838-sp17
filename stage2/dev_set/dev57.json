POINT.\n\nLatin American food that isn't super heavy and salty.  The food was actually very light and bright tasting.  \n\nWe were in for a late dinner so we didn't want to be overwhelmed with anything too heavy.  We wanted something light so we both opted for fish.  I had the open faced Papusa with with fish and my Husband had the fish tacos with a side of patacones.  \n\nBoth dishes were delicious all the way through and the sauces only made things better!  My husband loved the <green salsa> which he said it tasted like it had fresh avocado with a slight kick from the jalapenos.  He also said it was slightly sweet.  The <papusa> with fish was also very delicious.\n\nAfter we walked out we both said \"That was perfect\".  We only wish we came at a better hour so we could have ordered more then we had because we both wanted to try more.\n\nThe service was fast and friendly and helpful.  El Rincon Tico has now become one of our default \"go to\" restaurants.\n\nI can't wait to try everything!","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review","restaurant":{"name":"El Rincon Tico","neighborhood":"Williamson -
