I was so excited to find a veg restaurant in Madison. It is located in a very cute little area in what looks like an older part of town. I arrived just after opening and the staff was so friendly. I asked my servers advice on what to have and her suggestions were perfect. The <TLA sandwich> was so tasty and the cup of chili went perfectly with it. The cafe is also very comfy and I loved the decor. If I ever make it back to Madison, I would defiantly eat here again!","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review","restaurant":{"name":"The Green Owl","neighborhood":"Williamson - Marquette","address":"1970 Atwood Ave","city":"Madison","state":"WI","postal_code":"53704","latitude":43.0922989,"longitude":-89.355528,"stars":4.0,"review_count":201,"is_open":1,"attributes":["Alcohol: full_bar","Ambience: {'romantic': False, 'intimate': False, 'classy': False, 'hipster': False, 'divey': False, 'touristy': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'casual': True}","BikeParking: True","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards: True","BusinessParking: {'garage': False, 'street': True, 'validated': False, 'lot': False, 'valet': False}","Caters: False","GoodForKids: True","GoodForMeal: {'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': True, 'dinner': True, 'breakfast': False, 'brunch': False}","HasTV: False","NoiseLevel: average","OutdoorSeating: True","RestaurantsAttire: casual","RestaurantsDelivery: False","RestaurantsGoodForGroups: True","RestaurantsPriceRange2: 2","RestaurantsReservations: True","RestaurantsTableService: True","RestaurantsTakeOut: True","WheelchairAccessible: True","WiFi: no"],"categories":["Vegetarian","Restaurants","Vegan","Cafes"],"hours":["Tuesday 11:0-21:0","Wednesday 11:0-21:0","Thursday 11:0-21:0","Friday 11:0-21:0","Saturday 11:0-21:0","Sunday 10:0-15:0"],"type":"business"},"user":{"name":"Veggie","review_count":17,"yelping_since":"2008-12-16","friends":["None"],"useful":7,"funny":0,"cool":0,"fans":0,"elite":["None"],"average_stars":3.71,"compliment_hot":0,"compliment_more":0,"compliment_profile":0,"compliment_cute":0,"compliment_list":0,"compliment_note":0,"compliment_plain":1,"compliment_cool":0,"compliment_funny":0,"compliment_writer":0,"compliment_photos":0,"type":"user"},"fvs":[{"length":28,"ends_with_s":0,"has_cooking_style":0,"ends_with_common_food_names":0,"has_restaurant_name":0,"sentence_contains_adjective_words":0,"is_prev_word_a_definite_artice":0,"contains_the":0,"example_word_length":6,"capital":1,"word_fraction_capitalized":0,"is_positive":0,"text":"I have been meaning to write"},{"length":4,"ends_with_s":0,"has_cooking_style":0,"ends_with_common_food_names":0,"has_restaurant_name":0,"sentence_contains_adjective_words":0,"is_prev_word_a_definite_artice":0,"contains_the":0,"example_word_length":1,"capital":0,"word_fraction_capitalized":0,"is_positive":0,"text":"live"},{"length":19,"ends_with_s":0,"has_cooking_style":0,"ends_with_common_food_names":0,"has_restaurant_name":0,"sentence_contains_adjective_words":0,"is_prev_word_a_definite_artice":0,"contains_the":0,"example_word_length":4,"capital":0,"word_fraction_capitalized":0,"is_positive":0,"text":"and found this cafe"},{"length":25,"ends_with_s":0,"has_cooking_style":0,"ends_with_common_food_names":0,"has_restaurant_name":0,"sentence_contains_adjective_words":0,"is_prev_word_a_definite_artice":0,"contains_the":0,"example_word_length":6,"capital":0,"word_fraction_capitalized":0,"is_positive":0,"text":"is located in a very cute"},{"length":24,"ends_with_s":0,"has_cooking_style":0,"ends_with_common_food_names":0,"has_restaurant_name":0,"sentence_contains_adjective_words":0,"is_prev_word_a_definite_artice":0,"contains_the":0,"example_word_length":4,"capital":0,"word_fraction_capitalized":0,"is_positive":0,"text":"and her suggestions were"},{"length":14,"ends_with_s":0,"has_cooking_style":0,"ends_with_common_food_names":0,"has_restaurant_name":0,"sentence_contains_adjective_words":1,"is_prev_word_a_definite_artice":1,"contains_the":0,"example_word_length":2,"capital":1,"word_fraction_capitalized":0,"is_positive":1,"text":"TLA sandwich"},{"length":22,"ends_with_s":1,"has_cooking_style":0,"ends_with_common_food_names":0,"has_restaurant_name":1,"sentence_contains_adjective_words":1,"is_prev_word_a_definite_artice":0,"contains_the":1,"example_word_length":4,"capital":1,"word_fraction_capitalized":0,"is_positive":0,"text":"The TLA sandwich was"},{"length":3,"ends_with_s":0,"has_cooking_style":0,"ends_with_common_food_names":0,"has_restaurant_name":0,"sentence_contains_adjective_words":1,"is_prev_word_a_definite_artice":0,"contains_the":1,"example_word_length":1,"capital":0,"word_fraction_capitalized":0,"is_positive":0,"text":"the"},{"length":21,"ends_with_s":0,"has_cooking_style":0,"ends_with_common_food_names":0,"has_restaurant_name":1,"sentence_contains_adjective_words":0,"is_prev_word_a_definite_artice":0,"contains_the":1,"example_word_length":5,"capital":1,"word_fraction_capitalized":0,"is_positive":0,"text":"The cafe is also very"}]}
