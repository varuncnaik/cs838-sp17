I'd been wanting to try Tanner's for a while, as I'd often passed it while at Greenway Station, but sadly was disappointed with our experience here. It may have been me, but I didn't get a great vibe from this place inside. It had plenty of tvs, typical of sports bars, but it didn't have the fun comfortable atmosphere most sports bars have, in my opinion. The tables and chairs seemed old and uncomfortable, and the inside felt very small, dark, and crunched. The menu seemed to offer a lot of options, but no one in my party was impressed with the food. My brother ordered a <fish sandwich> that was described in the menu as a huge sandwich, but when it came, it was very small and didn't look appetizing at all. My <burger> was okay-nothing great, as was my husband's sandwich. The <fries> we got with our meals were luke warm at best and needed salt or some type of seasoning, as they had absolutely no flavor. For the price, there are many other places in Middleton I'd rather go than here.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review","restaurant":{"name":"Tanner's Bar and
