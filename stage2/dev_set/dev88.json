I believe his name is Daniel? Horrible customer service. I will not return until he no longer works at this establishment. He has a short temper and should not be working in a customer service field. I was at this bar last night and he tried to start something with my boyfriend over a corn dog he order? Which was on their late night menu (this was at 11pm?) apparently he had turned his equipment off and he only got the fries he ordered...my boyfriend questioned where his <corn dog> was? and the bartender goes \"COME HERE! COME HERE! (takes him aside) You wanna start something?\" Minutes before this happened I took a seat at the bar to play photo hunt, I was sitting next to an acquaintance and said \"oh I'm gonna come sit next to you\" and quickly say \"just kidding, I'm gonna play photo hunt, you wanna play?\" The bartender blurts in, \"Why would you wanna be with that douchbag?\" I thought he was kidding, I really thought he liked my boyfriend as the last time we were in that bar, he (the bartender) was talking to for quite a while. I only had one drink and the two guys I was with each had two beer. Nobody was drunk or acting up? He literally freaked out over a <CORN DOG>. We were all confused and talking at our table like WTF? and the table next to us said, yeah he just cut us off so were leaving and we're not even drunk. I worked in a bar for quite some time and this group was fine. They were drinking, playing games and really not even being loud. He told my boyfriend to leave in front of the whole bar while he was sitting eating his fries with me. He then told our friends at the bar \"he doesn't know what it is, but my boyfriends face makes him want to punch him.\" Pretty strange guy, somethings loose in his head. TOTALLY unexpected and TOTALLY miss treated, my boyfriend has been going to this bar for over 6 years and was friends with the previous owner, but he refuses to return until this guy is GONE!","useful":4,"funny":1,"cool":0,"type":"review","restaurant":{"name":"Lucky's Bar & Grille","neighborhood":"Vilas","address":"1421 Regent
