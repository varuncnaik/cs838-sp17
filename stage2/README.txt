The selected entity type is menu items. We defined each menu item as something
a person could order while speaking to a host or hostess at a restaurant. This
does not include ingredients in a dish.

The selected text documents are Yelp reviews. Each document is a JSON object
with information about that particular review, as well as the restaurant it is
reviewing and the user writing the review.

Since no Yelp reviews contained the "<" or ">" characters, we marked each menu
item as <menu item>.
