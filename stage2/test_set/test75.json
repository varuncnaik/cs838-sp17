We do not live in the city which makes it hard for us to enjoy dinner there.  Umami is only open for dinner.  We happened to be in town a bit later yesterday and went to try them out.  This place has always intrigued us.  Not any more!\nWe each ordered a plate of dumplings.  She had a plate of six vegan and I had nine pork.  We split a <summer roll> as an appetizer.  We enjoyed our drink and the roll.  It went downhill from there.  About 15 minutes or so after we finished our appetizer, our waiter stops by to tell us that they accidently served one of our entrees to another table and if we could choose another appetizer, on them, to nibble while they recooked our meal.  He served us our free App.  After another 15 min or so after we finished, someone shows with our food.  THey served me the six <dumpling> plate when I ordered nine.  I mentioned that to the girl and she said she would tell my waiter.  When I was about half done with my plate, the waiter stops be and I mentioned this again to him.  He finally shows up with my other three dumplings about 20 minutes after I finished the original six!  \nI denied the other three and asked they be removed from the bill so we could get out of there.  A manager never showed his/her face.\nThe intrigue is gone.  We have lived and eaten in the Madison for ten years and have NEVER gotten worst service as we did last night.  No, We will never return.","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review","restaurant":{"name":"Umami Ramen & Dumpling Bar","neighborhood":"Williamson - Marquette","address":"923 Williamson
