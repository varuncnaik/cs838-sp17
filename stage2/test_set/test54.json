The menu was fun to peruse, and I was pleased because there were several vegetarian options to choose from.  Entrees were served on either <rice> or <ethiopian bread> and were moderately sized and served with a <side salad>.  Several <African beers> were offered, which were fun to try.  Our waitress was not overly friendly, but attentive enough to be fine with me.  The main room seems to offer a bit more ambiance than the back room, which felt a little lacking in that department.  I'm not sure if it was the overhead lighting or the chairs, which felt a little rec room-like.  \n\nBOTTOM LINE:  Fair prices and several veg-friendly options.  I was glad we tried it and it was enjoyable enough for me to recommend.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review","restaurant":{"name":"Buraka Restaurant","neighborhood":"Capitol","address":"543
