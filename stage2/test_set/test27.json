They were offering a limited menu at that time, which was more than fine with us.  After a too long dinner the night before it allowed us to give Graze a whirl without subjecting our daughter to another two hour dinner.  \n\nService was nice, without being overly the top friendly - more of the down-to-earth level of friendly, which was nice and how I prefer service to be.  They very kindly parked our stroller for us and presented us with a very clean high chair - which, let me tell you, is a bit of a rarity.  I didn't have to wipe this one down before we placed our daughter in.  \n\nWe had a carb filled food fest here.  We started with the pretzel - delicious!  Loved the mustards (especially the tarragon and horseradish)  and the brick cheese spread was lovely.  We also went with a cheese plate and I was pleased with them all.  The <walnut bread> was quite nice and the compote was tasty.  We both went with the <Pub Burger> and were very impressed.  I love a burger with a little garden of loveliness on top, however, most places I have to pick off a not-yet-ripe tomato, or not-so-crisp onions or soggy lettuce.  I'm a bit of a pain in the ass when it comes to topping my burger - the ingredients must be perfect.  Theirs were complete and total perfection.  The only minor issue was my <English muffin> was a bit too soggy, but otherwise, it was delicious.  It was cooked perfectly medium rare and was the perfect size 1/4lb patty.  Delicious, not obnoxious and huge.  The portion of fries with a side of garlic aioli was enormous and tasty.  \n\nTruly, a great meal was had here!  I was nervous about bringing our daughter - but was touched by the fact that her presence was no big deal at all.  So, if you have kids and they're well behaved or you're good about being on top of their happiness while dining and are mindful of fellow diners - go ahead and bring them here.   We look forward to dining at Graze again!","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review","restaurant":{"name":"Graze","neighborhood":"Capitol","address":"1 S Pinckney
