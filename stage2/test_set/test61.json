{"review_id":"61tCEQvRQ0a-I3sove0NyQ","user_id":"V12HIIwQU-dYEQZBxEQTPg","business_id":"YgBQEX8dB27FdYj7PaPhPw","stars":3,"date":"2014-04-28","text":"We went on a Friday night and it was packed with families at 6 PM.  We were luckily able to nab a spot at the bar and not have to wait 20 minutes for a table.  The bartenders were busy, but we never had to wait unnecessarily long for service.  They have a very large beer selection and a well-stocked bar.  They had about 6 signature drinks.  I didn't get one, but I saw the <mint vodka lemonade> being made and it looked good!  They used fresh mint and muddled it.  \nThe menu was a little limited.  Lots of seafood options, so I don't recommend it if you aren't a fan of seafood, but if you are, it's a great place for you!  I got the Friday <fish fry> and had the option of cod or blue gill.  I chose the cod and it was pretty standard fish fry-nothing too special.  It was good and I enjoyed it, but it wasn't great.  I did like that they offered malt vinegar for the fish and fries and they served it with Ranch without me having to ask.  The <coleslaw> was good but a bit too acidic. \nMy fiancee got the <G&B Burger> and enjoyed it.  He especially liked the special sauce.  However, I was disappointed that it didn't come with any fries or other sides for the price that it was.\nI liked the decor and atmosphere.  It made me think of a New England pub with the emphasis on seafood and beer.  \nOverall, it was a good dinner and I can't complain about much, but I don't know if I'd go back.  It seems like a great place for families with kids because of the pizza options.  The prices seemed fair as well.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review","restaurant":{"name":"Gates & Brovi","neighborhood":"Dudgeon-Monroe","address":"3502 Monroe
