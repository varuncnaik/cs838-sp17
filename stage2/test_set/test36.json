The <Pad Thai> is a huge gamble, one time it is is sweet and not hot at all with four stars, the next time it is super greasy and not hot, the third time it is dry flavorless noodles CRUSTED in pepper seeds, completely indelibly hot.  And I grow my own chilies, I love hot food.  That has happened several times now.\n\nIt seems to have really gotten busy (though the last few months less so) with there often being four people running the front desk and it still takes a while to get their attention.  I think they have had trouble dealing with the success of the restaurant and keeping the same level of quality up.  I wish I could figure out what day the good cooks work and only order from them then.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review","restaurant":{"name":"Ha Long Bay Vietnamese & Thai
