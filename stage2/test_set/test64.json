I've been coming here for years but find their ever rising prices for mediocre food to be too much.  Tonight we got there around 5:15 and the parking lot was half empty so figured we wouldn't have to wait too long.  We were told 20-30 minutes. OK.  An hour later my wife checked in again and we were told 20 minutes.  Yeah, right, someone screwed our reservation up I think.\n\nSo finally at 6:40 we get in and I noticed the prices were significantly higher than what I remembered from last time.  $14 for a <cod> dinner?  So screw it I ordered a <burger> with a glass of water, one daughter also only had water. They had <meatloaf>, perch and chicken. No appetizers or desert.  With tip the meal was over $70.  And it wasn't worth $40.\n\nI'm done with the place.  Just too many other great places to eat out in Madison for much more reasonable prices.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review","restaurant":{"name":"Quivey's
