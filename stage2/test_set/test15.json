We have gone to Bonfyre for years and have enjoyed the food. In fact, we went armed with a coupon sent to us because of our past patronage. However, although we got there early on a Saturday (6:25) and the place was not crowded, the manager(?) asked if we had a reservation. We had never been asked that before. We then requested seating outdoors and although only two tables had patrons, we were given the worst of the remaining tables. They clearly gave us the impression they didn't want our business, so we left. Maybe they were worried because they had prom couples coming later. If there was some reason, they never told us.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review","restaurant":{"name":"Bonfyre American Grille","neighborhood":"","address":"2601 W Beltline Hwy","city":"Madison","state":"WI","postal_code":"53713","latitude":43.034735369,"longitude":-89.4225611388,"stars":3.5,"review_count":179,"is_open":1,"attributes":["Alcohol: full_bar","Ambience: {'romantic': False, 'intimate': False, 'classy': False, 'hipster': False, 'divey': False, 'touristy': False, 'trendy': True, 'upscale': False, 'casual': False}","BikeParking: False","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards: True","BusinessParking: {'garage': True, 'street': False, 'validated': False, 'lot': True, 'valet': False}","Caters: True","DogsAllowed: False","GoodForKids: False","GoodForMeal: {'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': False, 'dinner': True, 'breakfast': False, 'brunch': False}","HasTV: True","NoiseLevel: average","OutdoorSeating: True","RestaurantsAttire: casual","RestaurantsDelivery: False","RestaurantsGoodForGroups: True","RestaurantsPriceRange2: 2","RestaurantsReservations: True","RestaurantsTableService: True","RestaurantsTakeOut: True","WheelchairAccessible: True","WiFi: free"],"categories":["American (New)","Restaurants"],"hours":["Monday 11:0-22:0","Tuesday 11:0-22:0","Wednesday 11:0-22:0","Thursday 11:0-22:0","Friday 11:0-23:0","Saturday 12:0-23:0","Sunday 10:0-22:0"],"type":"business"},"user":{"name":"David","review_count":14,"yelping_since":"2013-06-16","friends":["None"],"useful":1,"funny":2,"cool":0,"fans":0,"elite":["None"],"average_stars":2.5,"compliment_hot":0,"compliment_more":0,"compliment_profile":0,"compliment_cute":0,"compliment_list":0,"compliment_note":1,"compliment_plain":0,"compliment_cool":0,"compliment_funny":0,"compliment_writer":0,"compliment_photos":0,"type":"user"},"fvs":[{"length":8,"ends_with_s":0,"has_cooking_style":0,"ends_with_common_food_names":0,"has_restaurant_name":0,"sentence_contains_adjective_words":0,"is_prev_word_a_definite_artice":0,"contains_the":0,"example_word_length":2,"capital":0,"word_fraction_capitalized":0,"is_positive":0,"text":"fact we"},{"length":29,"ends_with_s":0,"has_cooking_style":0,"ends_with_common_food_names":0,"has_restaurant_name":0,"sentence_contains_adjective_words":0,"is_prev_word_a_definite_artice":0,"contains_the":0,"example_word_length":5,"capital":0,"word_fraction_capitalized":0,"is_positive":0,"text":"because of our past patronage"},{"length":25,"ends_with_s":0,"has_cooking_style":0,"ends_with_common_food_names":0,"has_restaurant_name":0,"sentence_contains_adjective_words":0,"is_prev_word_a_definite_artice":0,"contains_the":0,"example_word_length":5,"capital":0,"word_fraction_capitalized":0,"is_positive":0,"text":"there early on a Saturday"},{"length":13,"ends_with_s":0,"has_cooking_style":0,"ends_with_common_food_names":0,"has_restaurant_name":0,"sentence_contains_adjective_words":0,"is_prev_word_a_definite_artice":0,"contains_the":1,"example_word_length":3,"capital":0,"word_fraction_capitalized":0,"is_positive":0,"text":"and the place"},{"length":23,"ends_with_s":0,"has_cooking_style":0,"ends_with_common_food_names":0,"has_restaurant_name":0,"sentence_contains_adjective_words":0,"is_prev_word_a_definite_artice":0,"contains_the":0,"example_word_length":5,"capital":0,"word_fraction_capitalized":0,"is_positive":0,"text":"if we had a reservation"},{"length":24,"ends_with_s":1,"has_cooking_style":0,"ends_with_common_food_names":0,"has_restaurant_name":0,"sentence_contains_adjective_words":0,"is_prev_word_a_definite_artice":0,"contains_the":0,"example_word_length":4,"capital":0,"word_fraction_capitalized":0,"is_positive":0,"text":"although only two tables"},{"length":27,"ends_with_s":0,"has_cooking_style":0,"ends_with_common_food_names":0,"has_restaurant_name":0,"sentence_contains_adjective_words":0,"is_prev_word_a_definite_artice":0,"contains_the":1,"example_word_length":5,"capital":0,"word_fraction_capitalized":0,"is_positive":0,"text":"us the impression they didn"}]}
