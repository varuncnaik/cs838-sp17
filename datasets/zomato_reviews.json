{"rating": 4, "review_text": "We originally tried to visit Estacion Inka earlier this summer. We stopped in on a hot August night. When we arrived, we discovered that they either have no air-conditioning or it was not working. Either way, we were dripping sweat while waiting for the rest of our party. We decided there was no way we would enjoy that so we left.  In October on a cooler evening, we decided to give it another try. I'm so glad we did!

{"rating": 4, "review_text": "We tried Everly for a late lunch last weekend. It had only been open for less than a week, but we were excited to try it. Bright, airy, windows which open to an outdoor patio area. It looks like a fun place to hang out for drinks.  We were greeted at the door by the hostess who escorted us to a booth. Our waiter then brought us water and menus. Since we arrived after lunch but before dinner they had a limited menu. We ordered the Avocado Toast and the Whitefish Toast.

The space is gorgeous, and SO not Bluphies! We shared the fried artichoke dish, and that\u00a0was absolutely fantastic. I had the Nor-Cal vegetarian sandwich, and found it to be a bit disjointed.
